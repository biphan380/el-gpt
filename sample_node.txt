Path, which is a well known affluent neighbourhood in Toronto.  It was
his second day delivering mail on that route.  He was wearing the
Canada Post coat, carrying a mail satchel, and delivering regular
mail and flyers.  He did not stop at every house as there was no mail

information. Constable Shaw found this suspicious.  Accordingly, they
drove up Vernham Court and stopped the  applicant.  [12] They asked
him for identification.  The applicant willingly and politely provided
his  driver’s licence and his Canada Post identification. Constable

be found discriminatory, must be consistent with the allegation of
discrimination and  inconsistent with any other rational explanation.

Text: 6 [22] Constable Shaw testified that a number of unusual
features, including the applicant’s behaviour, influenced his actions.
The features he asserted were unusual  are these: the applicant was
not the usual letter carrier, the applicant was crossing back  and
forth across the street, and the applicant did not stop at every
house.  These thre...seperator_starts@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@seperator_endsNode ID: 1a968e50-6084-4f6f-859a-7da25b89f9af

Shaw found it suspicious that the applicant knocked on a resident’s
door and spoke to a woman but did not  deliver any mail or flyers.
Mr. Finlay testified that it was not unusual to misdeliver mail  and
to go back and try to retrieve it, which is what the applicant did
that day.  Non...seperator_starts@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@seperator_endsNode ID: 0e2b2935-c9df-47aa-958d-baaa0d85a892

explanation that he was trying to teach Constable Noto about
alternative ways to complete an investigation and  find instead that
Constable Shaw’s heightened scrutiny of the applicant was continuing.

the police car while they did the check.   [37] I accept the
applicant’s evidence that he felt intimidated by being approached by

very large man.  I  note that the applicant has a small stature. I
