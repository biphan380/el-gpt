 3 INTRODUCTION  
[1] This Application alleges discrimination with respect to  employment  because of 
race, colour, ancestry, place of origin, ethnic origin, family status, marital status and age 
contrary to the Human Rights Code , R.S.O. 1990, c. H.19, as amended (the “ Code ”). 
Although all of the grounds enumerated above were identified in the original Application, 
at the hearing , the applicant, through counsel, focussed on race, colour, ethnic origin 
and age.   
[2] Specifically, t he applicant  asserts that she was not offered, or given the 
opportunity to compete for, a position that was given to a person who was  one of her 
direct reports , for reasons relating to the Code grounds identified. She asserts that she 
was, instead , left in the part of the company’s business that was being phased out.   
[3] The applicant  argues that this position was one that would have put her on a path 
to senior management within the r espondent organization and she was denied that 
opportunity because of Code  grounds . It was given, instead, to someone who was less 
experienced because the other candidate was younger and not a member of a 
racialized group . The applicant argues that this is a case of “systemic discrimination”.  
[4] The respondent denies discrimination, asserts that the applicant was a valued 
employee  who rose within the ranks of their organization rapidly and  argues that placing 
the applicant in the job in question would have amounted to a demotion  for the 
applicant , with a commensurate removal of management responsibilities and decreases 
in salary grade, amount and benefits .  
[5] The respondent  points out that the applicant did not approach any member of the 
senior management group about the job in question or indicate that she believed she 
had been discriminated against until her exit interview by which time she had already 
voluntarily  resigned her employment . The respondent  seeks dismissal of the 
Application.  
2016 HRTO 107 (CanLII)  
 4 [6] This Application was heard over four days in February and May, 2014.  For the 
reasons that follow, this Application is dismissed.  
THE LAW  
[7] The relevant sections of the Code  are as follows:  
5(1) Every person has a right to equal treatment with respect to 
employment without discrimination because of race, ancestry, place of 
origin, colour, ethnic origin, citizenship, creed, sex, sexual orientation, 
gender identity, gender expression, age, record of  offences, marital status, 
family status or disability.  
(2) Every person who is an employee has a right to freedom from 
harassment in the workplace by the employer or agent of the employer or 
by another employee because of race, ancestry, place of origin,  colour, 
ethnic origin, citizenship, creed, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender 
expression, age, record of offences, marital status, family status or 
disability.

THE FACTS  
[8] The applicant is a woman in her early forties of South Asian descent.  At the time 
of the hearing, she had ju st turned 42. She is married and the mother of a 5 -year-old 
daughter. She was born in Kuwait and raised  in the United States. She self-identifies as 
being Indian and describes  herself as racialized.  
2016 HRTO 107 (CanLII)  
 5 [9] The applicant has a Bachelor’s  degree in Health Care Administration from Texas 
State University, from where she graduated in 1998. While employed by the 
respondent, she completed an industry -related course between August 2010 and 
December 2011 and received a certificate from IFEBP. She  also took an Excel 
workshop to improve her skills.  The courses completed while she was employed by the 
respondent were paid for by the respondent.  
[10] Prior to her joining the respondent company, she worked at the Ontario 
Pharmacy Association  (“OPA ”) from 200 6 to December 2009, as an insurance co -
ordinator , where she  managed claims . Prior to her tenure at the OPA, she worked at 
Inhealth solutions from 2004 to September 2005 as a client services associate and 
managed medical portions of automobile claims.  
[11] Prior  to these jobs, she worked in Dallas, Texas at Travellers, a property and 
casualty insurance company  from April 1999 through to August 2002. She initially 
worked as a worker ’s compensation claims m anager and then in the company’s 
subrogation  department .  
[12] The applicant describes the respondent business as one created by the Ontario 
Dental Association (the “ODA”) t o manage claims . The O DA is the only shareholder  of 
the company. It is housed in same building and share s office space .   
[13] The parties agree that the applicant was a good employee , received excellent 
performance reviews and rose within the ranks very quickly.    
[14] The applicant began working for the respondent company on April 5, 2010. At the 
time she was hired, she worked in a non -management role at a salary of $44,500.00. 
She was considered to be part of salary grade 7. She received a performance bonus of 
3.5% that year.  
2016 HRTO 107 (CanLII)

2016 HRTO 107 (CanLII)  
 6 [15] One year later, she was promoted to the manager level. Her salary increased by 
more than $10.000.00 to $57,500.0 0, and she went from salary grade 7 to 10. In 
January, 2012, she received another $1,000.00 raise.  
[16] As of June, 2012, she was manager of group administration and had seen a 
$23,000.00 increase in her salary and had moved up 5 grids on the salary scale in a 
two-year period. By that time, she was at salary grade 12  and earning $67,500.00 . 
[17] The parties spent some time during the hearing providing me with evidence 
about the racial composition of the workplace.  The applicant asserts that the executive 
management group is made up exclusively of non -racialized persons, while the 
composition of the administrative and clerical staff is more diverse and includes some 
racialized members.   
[18] The respondent indicates that the applicant was part of the management team 
and, as a result, there were racialized persons within the management structure of the 
company.  It also argues that the executive management group is diverse in ways not 
having to do with race but in respect of gender and sexual orientation. The respondent 
agreed that the staff is diverse and includes racialized persons.   
[19] At the time the applicant worked at the respondent company, it had two main 
lines of business ; public and private. The public side managed dental benefits for some 
public organizations such a s children’s aid societies and social assistance recipients . To 
use the language of the industry, it amounted to approximately 300,000 “lives” and 
constituted about 80% of the company’s business.  
[20] The other side of the business , the private side, involved a cting a s a third -party 
administrator for employers who funded their own benefits plans  health (vision, hospital, 
medical equipment, prescription) and dental. The company would create booklets, 
provide cards to employees, receive and pay claims. They would charge an 
admin istrative  fee for this service  and the client  would be billed monthly or quarterly.  
The private side represented 20% of the respondent’s business .   
2016 HRTO 107 (CanLII)  
 7 [21] The applicant worked on the private side of the business. She testified that w hen 
she came on board, the private side was in a state of disarray. There had been a 
number of team lead s, customers had expressed dissatisfaction , and there had been 
instances of overpayments  or claims not being paid properly.   
[22] The p rivate side of the bu siness was not growing. Some groups were cancelling  
contracts  and the few coming on were smaller. The applicant testified that d uring a 
meeting with staff in the summer of 2012, Doug Cooper , the respondent’s CEO,  had 
indicated that the respondent would not be investing in the private side and would, 
instead, be focussing on the public side of the business.  
[23] The applicant testified that, as a result, she was looking for opportunities to work 
on the public side of th e business and learn more about it. She was interested in 
eventually moving into the senior or executive management group and knew that in 
order to do so, she would need to be come an integral  part of the public side of the 
company’s business.  Although she had made her interest in moving to the public side of 
the business  known , she had not been  given any opportunities to do so.

[23] The applicant testified that, as a result, she was looking for opportunities to work

eventually moving into the senior or executive management group and knew that in 
order to do so, she would need to be come an integral  part of the public side of the 
company’s business.  Although she had made her interest in moving to the public side of 
the business  known , she had not been  given any opportunities to do so.   
[24] The applicant was caught by surprise  when , on December 6, 2012, she was told 
by the CEO, Doug Cooper, and Sandy Fick , a member of  the executive management 
team , that  “CQ” , a member of the team that reported to her , was being moved to  a 
newly created position  on the public side of the business . In her new role, CQ would be 
reporting directly to Sandy Fick.   
[25] The job had not been posted, an open competition had not been held and, in the 
applicant’ s opinion , there were several more qualified and experienced candidates for 
the job that could have been selected.  
[26] Although her team had been reduced by the departure of CQ, the applicant was 
told that the  position would not be refilled and the  workload would have to be 
redistributed between the remaining staff on the team .   
2016 HRTO 107 (CanLII)  
 8 [27] The applicant believed that this signalled that CQ was being groomed for a 
position in the senior or executive managemen t group, something to which she aspired.  
She believed that she was being left in a part of the business that was dying out.  
[28] She did not raise her discrimination concerns during the meeting on December 6, 
2012. However, she did object to the fact that her t eam would now have to continue to 
operate with fewer resources . She  later sent an email seeking  additional pay for the 
team as a result of the higher workload; a request that was denied.  
[29] I heard a great deal of evidence about the applicant’s view that the process by 
which this job was created and filled was irregular and that while she considered CQ a 
good employee  and had provided her with positive performance reviews , she did not 
find her to be  an exceptional one . She also te stified that CQ’s qualifications and 
experience  were not so stellar that she was an obvious fit for the job. The applicant’s 
view was that o ther older and racialized employees had been overlooked by the 
respondent when filling the job without a competition , including  the applicant.   
[30] The applicant filed the instant Application to the Tribunal on December 10, 2012 , 
and resigned her employment on December 20, 2012 , as she felt she could not 
continue in her job with the respondent . The parties agree that d uring  her exit interview 
with Doug Cooper on January 4, 2013, the applicant  raised the issue of discrimination  
with the respondent for the first time . 
[31] The applicant says that during that meeting, when she raised the issue of 
discrimination and the improper transfer of CQ, she was told that the position was given 
to CQ because she was a good fit and had skill s, such as marketing,  that the applicant 
did not.   
[32] Doug Cooper’s version of what took place during that meeting differs. H e gave 
evidence that  when the appl icant resigned, he had assumed initially that she had found 
another job, perhaps with a competitor, and he was sorry to see her go. He says he 
knew that the applicant was upset that CQ had been transferred out of her department

surprised when the applicant raised the issue of discrimination.

[33] Doug Cooper says that the respondent valued the applicant’s contribution  and 
that she had been instrumental in sorting out issues in her department and then 
ensuring the continued smooth operation of the private side of the business.  
[34] He indicated that although the respondent was engaged in restructuring  
activities , any plans to divest itself of the private side of the business did not inclu de an 
intention to let the applicant go. He confirmed that the company’s plans for the applicant  
involved having her eventually move into the role of manager of operations but 
acknowledged that had not yet been communicated to her.    
[35] Doug Cooper  says that during his meetings with the applicant he had tried to 
explain to her that th e reason the position was created was that in November, 2012, a 
new software system had been purchased and Sandy Fick’s responsibilities were 
increasing as a result of this purcha se.  Sandy Fick  needed additional administrative 
assistance.  The job CQ was put into, according to him, was  an administrative role , with 
no management duties or responsibilities and compensated at a much lower level – 
salary grade 9.  He said that the execu tive management team had never considered 
demoting the applicant to take on that role.  
DECISION  
[36] This Application alleges an infringement of section 5 of the Code , which provides 
that every person has the right to equal treatment  with respect to employment without 
discrimination on the basis of race, ancestry, place of origin, colour, ethnic origin, 
citizenship, creed, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, age, 
record of offences, marital status, family status or disability.  
[37] The appli cant has the onus of proving on a balance of probabilities that an 
infringement of the Code  has occurred.   A balance of probabilities means that it is more 
likely than not an infringement has occurred.  
2016 HRTO 107 (CanLII)  
 10 [38] Discrimination is not defined in the Code , but has been the subject of much 
judicial consideration. In Andrew s v. Law  Society of British Columbia , [1989] 1 S.C.R. 
143, in discussing the meaning of discrimination under the Charter of Rights and 
Freedoms,  the Supreme Court of Canada stated:  
…discri mination may be described as a distinction, whether intentional or 
not but based on grounds relating to the personal characteristics of the 
individual or group which has the effect of imposing burdens, obligations, 
or disadvantages on such individual or gr oup not imposed on others, or 
which withholds or limits access to opportunities, benefits, and advantages 
available to other members of society. Distinctions based on personal 
characteristics attributed to an individual solely on the basis of association 
with a group will rarely escape the charge of discrimination, while those 
based on an individual’s merits and capacities will rarely be so classified.  
[39] Subsequent decisions of the Supreme Court of Canada have gone on to say 
that discrimination under both th e Code  and the Charter  require the applicant to 
establish a distinction on a prohibited ground to a member of a protected group that 
creates a disadvantage by perpetuating disadvantage or prejudice, or by stereotyping.  
See: Law  v. Canada (Minister of Empl oyment and Immigration) , [1999] 1 S.C.R. 497, R. 
v. Kapp , 2008 SCC 41, and Withler v. Canada (Attorney General) , 2011 SCC 12.

Distinctions based on personal

[39] Subsequent decisions of the Supreme Court of Canada have gone on to say 
that discrimination under both th e Code  and the Charter  require the applicant to 
establish a distinction on a prohibited ground to a member of a protected group that 
creates a disadvantage by perpetuating disadvantage or prejudice, or by stereotyping.  
See: Law  v. Canada (Minister of Empl oyment and Immigration) , [1999] 1 S.C.R. 497, R. 
v. Kapp , 2008 SCC 41, and Withler v. Canada (Attorney General) , 2011 SCC 12.  
[40] In order to establish that her right to equal treatment in respect of employment 
has been infringed by the respondent, the applicant must es tablish that she has been 
subjected to differential and disadvantageous treatment on the basis of a Code  ground 
or that a neutral rule or requirement has had a differential impact on her resulting in 
disadvantage as a result of her members hip in a group identified by a Code  ground.  
[41] The applicant argues that this is not a case of direct discrimination. Instead, she 
argues that this is a case of “systemic discrimination”  and has argued that the principles 
in the Supreme Court of Canada’s decision in Ontario Human Rights Commission v. 
Simpson s-Sears , [1985] 2 S.C.R. 536, apply . 
[42] She says that the respondent company’s senior or executive management group 
is exclusively Cauca sian and there are no racialized persons within that group. She also 
2016 HRTO 107 (CanLII)  
 11 asserts that j obs involving administrative and support functions in the company were 
filled by r acialized  persons , such as the applicant.   
[43] She argues that the decision to create a positio n and fill it without competition 
with a younger white woman is evidence that the respondent seeks to perpetuate that 
state of inequality and that decision resulted in a disadvantage to her  on the basis of 
Code grounds . 
[44] The respondent disagrees and argues that the applicant was, herself, a member 
of the management team of the respondent business before she resigned and it is 
inaccurate, therefore, to suggest that the management team is exclusively Caucasian 
and non -racialized. It says that there is diversit y both within the broader company as 
well the executive management team.  
[45] The respondent also argues that its decision to create and fill a new position 
without an open competition within the workplace was not in contravention of its own 
policies as it is o pen to the company to promote staff without a competition  and points 
out that one of the applicant’s own promotions did not involve a competition .  
[46] In any event, the respondent argues that the position in question was an 
administrative one and not a stepping stone to a seat a t the executive management 
table, as the applicant has assumed . It argues that the position created was not a 
management position and placing the applicant in that position would have amounted to 
demoting her  because of the lower salary grade, lower compensation level, lesser 
vacation entitlement and removal of management  tasks and responsibilities . 
[47] I am not persuaded of the relevance of the current racial composition  of the 
executive management group within the responde nt company to the issue s at hand. 
Assuming , without finding , that the executive management team was made up of 
exclusively non -racialized persons, that finding would not, in and of itself, lead me to 
conclude that the rights of the individual applicant in this Applic ation were infringed as a 
result of the racial composition of the various job categories within the company.  
2016 HRTO 107 (CanLII)  
 12 [48] The event that brought matters to a head for the applicant was the creation of a 
job and the appointment of CQ to that job by the executive managem ent group.

[47] I am not persuaded of the relevance of the current racial composition  of the 
executive management group within the responde nt company to the issue s at hand. 
Assuming , without finding , that the executive management team was made up of 
exclusively non -racialized persons, that finding would not, in and of itself, lead me to 
conclude that the rights of the individual applicant in this Applic ation were infringed as a 
result of the racial composition of the various job categories within the company.  
2016 HRTO 107 (CanLII)  
 12 [48] The event that brought matters to a head for the applicant was the creation of a 
job and the appointment of CQ to that job by the executive managem ent group.  
[49] Indeed, before that event, it is undisputed that the applicant , a racialized person,  
had experienced a steady and rapid progression through the ranks of the respondent 
company, had not raised any issues regarding being overlooked for promotion and 
advancement , and had not identified any barriers being placed in her path  or 
opportunities to which she or other racialized employees had been denied access.   
[50] Again, assuming , without finding , that the new position was improperly filled, 
without posting it and holding an open competition, it is not disputed that the p osition 
was one that  was at salary grade 9 and compensated at a level lower than the 
applicant’s salary in Dece mber, 2012.    
[51] If the job was improperly filled and I was to accept that there was, as the 
applicant argues, a “preferential hiring” or promotion of CQ, it resulted in CQ filling a 
position that would have amounted to a demotion for the applicant.  
[52] In other words, if there w as a preferential hiring or promotion of CQ, and 
differential treatment or a differential impact based in part on Code  grounds  occurred , 
those disad vantaged by these events  would have been co -workers working in positions 
alongside CQ, not the applicant, who was her manager.  It would be those individuals 
who could suggest that they had a legitimate grievance about the events in question.  
[53] I am not persuaded by the applicant’s evidence or argument that there was any 
discernable disadvantage arising out of the hiring or promotion of CQ to the applicant. 
Any future possible disadvantage to the applicant or advantage to CQ from the latter 
being placed in t his job , envisioned by the applicant , is speculative  and remote.  
[54] The mere fact that another person in the respondent company is promoted into 
another position does not lead inevitably to the conclusion that the applicant is being 
2016 HRTO 107 (CanLII)  
 13 disadvantaged or harmed as a result , particularly if, as is the case here, the transfer 
would amount to a demotion .   
[55] Even if the applicant is correct in assuming that CQ was being groomed to move 
up in the company, it does not follow that the applicant was disadvantaged or that her 
history of advancement and promotion was going to be negatively  impacted  going 
forward , i.e. that she would no longer being considered or “groomed” for advancement 
in the respondent company .  That is a conclusion, based on an assumption made by the 
applicant, that I do not find supported by the evidence that I have he ard. 
[56] Finally, even if I were to accept that the applicant was disadvantaged by not 
being given an opportunity to compete for the position CQ was placed into, I find that 
the respondent has provided me with a non -discriminatory explanation , unconnected to 
any Code  grounds,  for its failure to consider the applicant for that job, specifically that it 
would have amounted to a demotion to consider or place her in the job and the 
respondent did not wish to demote the applicant.  
[57] As a result, I find that t he applic ant has not established  on a balance of 
probabilities that her right  to equal treatment in respect of employment under the Code

  2023 HRTO 1081 (CanLII)  
 3 INTRODUCTION 
[1] On April 19, 2018, the applicant filed an Application alleging the respondent 
discriminated against him with respect to employment on the basis of family status 
contrary to the Human Rights Code, R.S.O. 1990 c. H. 19, as amended (the “Code”).  
[2]  By Case Assessment Direction (“CAD”) dated March 8, 2023, the Tribunal 
directed that a summary hearing be held to address whether the Application should be 
dismissed on the basis that there is no reasonable prospect that it will succeed pursuant 
to Rule 19A of the Tribunal’s Rules of Procedure.  
[3] As explained more fully below, I find that the Application must be dismissed on the 
basis that it has no reasonable prospect of success under the Code. Even if I accept all 
the facts alleged by the applicant as true, the applicant has not been able to point to any 
evidence beyond his own suspicions that the respondent was treating him differently 
based on Code grounds. 
SUMMARY HEARING PROCESS 
[4] The summary hearing process is described in Rule 19A of the Tribunal’s Rules of 
Procedure (‘Rules”) as well as the Tribunal’s Practice Direction on Summary Hearing
Requests. The purpose of a summary hearing is to consider whether an Application 
should be dismissed in whole or in part because there is no reasonable prospect that the 
Application will succeed. 
[5]  The Tribunal cannot address allegations of unfairness that are unrelated to the 
Code. The Tribunal’s jurisdiction is limited to claims of discrimination that are linked to the 
protections set out in the Code. 
[6] The test that is applied at the summary hearing stage is whether an Application 
has no reasonable prospect of success. At this stage, the Tribunal is not determining 
whether the applicant is telling the truth or assessing the impact of the treatment he 
experienced. The test of no reasonable prospect of success is determined by assuming 2023 HRTO 1081 (CanLII)  
 4 the applicant’s version of events is true unless there is some clear evidenceto the 
contrary or the evidence is not disputed by the applicant. 
[7] However, and significantly, accepting the facts alleged by the applicant does not 
include accepting the applicant’s assumptions about why he was treated unfairly. The 
purpose of the summary hearing is to determine whether the applicant can point to any 
information which tends to support his belief that he has experienced discrimination under 
the Code.

[6] The test that is applied at the summary hearing stage is whether an Application 
has no reasonable prospect of success. At this stage, the Tribunal is not determining 
whether the applicant is telling the truth or assessing the impact of the treatment he 
experienced. The test of no reasonable prospect of success is determined by assuming 2023 HRTO 1081 (CanLII)  
 4 the applicant’s version of events is true unless there is some clear evidenceto the 
contrary or the evidence is not disputed by the applicant. 
[7] However, and significantly, accepting the facts alleged by the applicant does not 
include accepting the applicant’s assumptions about why he was treated unfairly. The 
purpose of the summary hearing is to determine whether the applicant can point to any 
information which tends to support his belief that he has experienced discrimination under 
the Code. The question that the Tribunal must decide at a summary hearing is whether 
there is likely to be any evidence, or any evidence that may be reasonably available to 
the applicant to connect the unfair treatment allegedly experienced by the applicant with 
theCode’s protections. 
[8] As the Tribunal indicated in Forde v. Elementary Teachers’ Federation of Ontario, 
2011 HRTO 1389 (“Forde”), for an Application to continue in the Tribunal’s process 
following a summary hearing, there must be a basis beyond mere speculation and 
accusations to believe that an applicant could show a breach of the Code. 
[9] Having set out the basic framework for determining whether an Application should 
be dismissed because it has no reasonable prospect of success, I now turn to the facts 
of this particular case. 
FACTUAL BACKGROUND 
[10] The applicant worked as a court reporter with the Ministry of the Attorney General 
at the Brampton Courthouse located at 7755 Hurontario Street in Brampton, Ontario. 
There are 52 courtrooms each with a court reporter who are required to come into the 
courtroom 30 minutes before the start of the scheduled proceeding to ensure the 
equipment is properly set up.  
[11] The standard practice of scheduling court reporters at the Brampton courthouse 
begins at 8.30 a.m., 9.00 a.m. or 9.30 a.m. for court proceedings which start 30 minutes 
later respectively. 2023 HRTO 1081 (CanLII)  
 5 [12] The applicant states he needed to drop off his children at school for 9.20 a.m. and 
had an informal arrangement for the 2016-2017 school year to start work at 9.30 a.m. for 
a 10 a.m. court proceeding.  
[13] In September/October 2017, the applicant alleges he was asked questions about 
this arrangement by management and directed to submit a formal request for 
accommodation. The applicant’s requestfor accommodation was denied in February 
2018, following a meeting with management and scheduled for shifts beginning at 9.30 
a.m. for four weeks in order to make alternative arrangements but thereafter no guarantee 
was given that every shift would start at 9.30 a.m. for a court starting time of 10.00 a.m... 
[14] The applicant alleges that he was scheduled for 9.00 a m on March 14,2018 but 
did not report to work and on March 29,2018, reported late and did not work that day. 
[15]  The applicant’s position is essentially that the respondent’s conductevinced an 
intention to use constructive dismissal as a way to get him to accept the scheduling 
changes or leave their employment which occurred on March 29, 2018. 
FINDINGS   
[16] The applicant clearly disagrees with the treatment by the respondent involving the 
allegations about the level of support given and the loss of his employment by constructive 
dismissal. However, the applicant has not pointed to any evidence of any link between 
the respondent and the alleged unfair treatment and a Code ground. 
[17] The applicant believes he had been unfairly treated and for the applicant this was 
an issue. However, there is no evidence the applicant has or can point to that the 
applicant’sCode ground was a factor in the actions of the respondent.

[18] Despite being given the opportunity during the summary hearing to inform the 
Tribunal of evidence in his possession or that may be reasonably available at the merits 
hearing, the applicant could not point to any evidence to make the connection between 2023 HRTO 1081 (CanLII)  
 6 the alleged lack of support and the loss of employment with the respondent and hisCode-
enumerated ground. 
[19] The Tribunal” does not have jurisdiction over general allegations of unfairness 
unrelated to the Code”: Hay v. Ontario (Human Rights Tribunal), 2014 ONSC 2858: Bello 
v. Toronto Transit Commission, 2014 ONSC 5535. To fall within the Tribunal’s jurisdiction, 
“an Application must provide some factual basis beyond a bald assertion which link’s their
ground(s) to the respondent’s actions and explains why they think that these actions are 
discriminatory in nature “: Hay, at para. 8. 
[20] In Mehedi v. Mondalez Bakery,2023 ONSC 1737, the Divisional Court decided the 
Tribunal’s decision to dismiss the Application was reasonable and citedHay and Xia v. 
Board of Governors of Lakehead University, 2020 ONSC 6150 (Div. Ct.), which upheld 
the Tribunal’s dismissal of anApplication for lack of jurisdiction on the basis that the 
applicant failed to establisha basis “beyond mere speculation and accusations” that the
respondent’s conduct was discriminatorily linked to an enumerated ground. 
[21] As noted above, for an Application to advance to a full hearing on the merits, an 
applicant must be able to point to some evidence beyond his own suspicions, that could 
make out a link to theCode. The Tribunal has repeatedly said that an applicant’sbelief, 
no matter how strongly held, is not evidence upon which the Tribunal might find that 
discrimination has occurred. See for example Leong v. Ontario (Attorney General), 2014 
HRTO 311.  
[22] The applicant has not pointed to any evidence that he has or has reasonably 
available to him that could establish a connection between the respondent’s actions and 
his Code ground.  These allegations have no reasonable prospect of success. 2023 HRTO 1081 (CanLII)

ORDER 
[23] For the above reasons, the Application is dismissed.

 3 INTRODUCTION  
[1] This Application alleges discrimination with respect to employment because of 
disability, family status and reprisal contrary to the Human Rights Code , R.S.O. 1990, c. 
H.19, as amended (the “ Code ”). 
[2] The applicant alleges that the respondent  failed to comply  with its duty to 
accommodate the applicant’s disabilit y subsequent to  a motor vehicle accident which 
occurred on November 27, 2017  and further that the respondent discriminated against 
the applicant on the basis of disability, family status and reprisal  in relation to the 
termination of the applicant’s employment on January 19, 2018.  
[3] The respondent denies any discrimination in violation of the Code . 
[4] For the reasons provided below and based on the evidence presented at the merit s 
hearing and the written s ubmissions of the parties, I conclude that the applicant has not 
proven, on a balance of probabilities, that the respondent’s conduct amounts to 
discrimination in violation of the Code.  Accordingly,  the Application is dismissed.  
PROCEDURAL BACKGROUN D 
[5] In the Application , the applicant initially sought, among other things, a declaration 
that the applicant’s employment with the respondent was wrongfully terminated, together 
with damages for wrongful dismissal.   
[6] At noted in the Case Assessment Direction dated September 8, 2022, i n the face 
of the respondent’s  Form 10  Request for an Order During Proceeding s for a dismissal of 
all claims based on the wrongful dismissal allegations , the applicant agreed to withdraw 
those claims.  Accordingly,  and in accordance with the jurisdiction of this Tribunal, this 
Application proceeded solely with regards to any breach of the Code  on the grounds of 
disability, family status and reprisal in the social area of employme nt.  
[7] A merit s hearing in this matter was held on December 15, 2022.  
2023 HRTO 376 (CanLII)  
 4 [8] The applicant called two witnesses, namely  himself and Rachel Joanne Persad -
Moham med, his spouse.   
[9] The respondent called five witnesses, namely : Heino Cla essens, former CEO  
(“Claessens ”): JF Bosse, former National Sales Manager and current General Manager : 
Suzanne McGrattan, Controller  (“McGrattan ”); Richard Carbis, Service Manager ; and 
Sharon Pateman, Order Desk Manager .  
[10] An Agreed Statement of Facts and Joint Book of Documents  were filed by the 
parties. Multiple  exhibits were filed by the parties, all on consent.

Sharon Pateman, Order Desk Manager .  
[10] An Agreed Statement of Facts and Joint Book of Documents  were filed by the 
parties. Multiple  exhibits were filed by the parties, all on consent.  
CREDIBILITY  
[11] To determine whether the Code  was violated , I must make findings of fact based 
on an assessment of the evidence, and where the evidence conflicts, I must assess the 
credibility and reliability of the witnesses’ conflicting accounts of what happened. In 
assessing credibility, I have relied, when nec essary, on the principles in Faryna v. Chorny , 
[1952] 2 DLR 354 (BCCA), in particular the following:  
… Opportunities for knowledge, powers of observation, judgment and 
memory, ability to describe clearly what he has seen and heard, as well as 
other factors , combine to produce what is called credibility.  
… 
The credibility of interested witnesses, particularly in cases of conflict of 
evidence cannot be gauged solely by the test of whether the personal 
demeanour of the particular witness carried conviction of  the truth. The test 
must reasonably subject his story to an examination of its consistency with 
the probabilities that surround the currently existing conditions. In short, the 
real test of the truth of the story of the witness in such a case must be its 
harmony with the preponderance of the probabilities which a practical and 
informed person would readily recognize as reasonable in that place and in 
those conditions (…) Again, a witness may testify to what he sincerely 
believes to be true, but he may be q uite honestly mistaken. (pa ges 356-
357)  
2023 HRTO 376 (CanLII)  
 5 [12] I also have relied on the observations on credibility assessment made in R. v. 
Taylor , 2010 ONCJ 396, cited by the Tribunal in Soheil -Fakhaei v. Canadian Business 
College , 2012 HRTO 172 as follows:  
Testimonial evid ence can raise veracity and accuracy concerns. The former 
relate to the witness's sincerity, that is his or her willingness to speak the 
truth as the witness believes it to be. The latter concerns relate to the actual 
accuracy of the witness's testimony. T he accuracy of a witness's testimony 
involves considerations of the witness's ability to accurately observe, recall 
and recount the events in issue. When one is concerned with a witness's 
veracity, one speaks of the witness's credibility. When one is conce rned 
with the accuracy of a witness's testimony, one speaks of the reliability of 
that testimony. Obviously a witness whose evidence on a point is not 
credible cannot give reliable evidence on that point. The evidence of a 
credible, that is honest witness,  may, however, still be unreliable. See R v. 
Morrissey , 1995 CanL II 3498 (ON C. A.) at para. 205  
[13] Depending on the circumstances, some portions of a witness’ testimony may be 
more credible or worthy of belief than other portions. Accordingly, I can, with good reason, 
accept all, some or none of any witness’ evidence: see R. v. R.E.M. , 2008 SCC 51, at 
para 65.

employment without discrimination because of race, ancestry, place of 
origin, colour, ethnic origin , citizenship, creed, sex, sexual orientation, 
gender identity, gender expression, age, record of offences, marital status, 
family status or disability.  
… 
8. Every person has a right to claim and enforce his or her  rights under this 
Act, to institute and participate in proceedings under this Act and to refuse 
to infringe a right of another person under this Act, without reprisal or threat 
of reprisal for so doing.  
2023 HRTO 376 (CanLII)  
 6 9. No person shall infringe or do, directly or indirectly, anything that infringes 
a right under this Part.  
… 
10. (1) … “disability ” means, (a) any degree of physical disability, infirmity, 
malformation or disfigurement that is caused by bodily injury. . .  
Onus  
[15] The applicant has the onus of proving, o n a balance of probabilities, that a violation 
of the Code  has occurred.  What this means is that it is more probable than not that a 
violation of the Code  occurred.  Clear, convincing, and cogent evidence is required in 
order to satisfy the balance the prob abilities test.  See F.H. v. McDougall , 2008 SCC 53 
at para. 46.  
Prima Facie Test  
[16] To meet the traditional three step test for  prima facie  discrimination as set out by 
the Supreme Court  of Canada in  Moore v. British Columbia (Education) , 2012 SCC 61  at 
para.  33, the applicant must show that:  
1. The applicant has a protected characteristic under the  Code . 
2. The applicant suffered disadvantage or an adverse im pact; and  
3. The protected characteristic was a factor in the disadvantage or adverse 
impact.  
[17] In Garofalo v. Cavalier Hair Stylists Shop Inc. , 2013 HRTO 170 , at para.  155, the 
Tribunal further noted:  
… If the applicant establishes a  prima facie  case of dis crimination, the 
respondent must establish, on a balance of probabilities, a statutory 
defence and/or a credible non -discriminatory explanation for the impugned 
treatment. If the respondent is able to rebut the applicant’s  prima facie  case 
of discriminatio n, the burden returns to the applicant to establish, on a 
balance of probabilities, that the respondent’s explanation is erroneous or 
a pretext for discrimination.  See Wedley v. Northview Co -operative Homes 
2023 HRTO 376 (CanLII)
  
 7 Inc., 2008 HRTO 13  at para.  52. The ultimate issue is whether the applicant 
has proven, on a balance of probabilities, that a violation of the  Code  has 
occurred. Although an evidentiary burden to rebut discrimination may shift 
to the respondent, the onus of proving discriminati on remains on the 
applicant throughout. See  Ontario (Disability Support Program) v. 
Tranchemontagne , 2010 ONCA 593  at paras.  112 and 119 . 
[18] As noted in  Peel Law Association v. Pieters , 2013 ONCA 396  (“Pieters ”), at 
paras.

Tranchemontagne , 2010 ONCA 593  at paras.  112 and 119 . 
[18] As noted in  Peel Law Association v. Pieters , 2013 ONCA 396  (“Pieters ”), at 
paras.  82-84, in a case where there has been a full hearing on the merits, the  prima 
facie  analysis is not nece ssarily required.  Pieters  at para.  83, stated:  
… After a fully contested case, the task of the tribunal is to decide the 
ultimate issue whether the respondent discriminated against the applicant. 
After the case is over, whether the applicant has establishe d a prima 
facie  case, an interim question, no longer matters. The question to be 
decided is whether the applicant has satisfied the legal burden of proof of 
establishing on a balance of probabilities that the discrimination has 
occurred.  
[19] The prima facie  analysis may, however, as further noted in  Pieters  in para.  84, be 
useful as an analytic tool to consider whether the applicant has been able to establish 
discrimination.  
[20] As further noted in Pieters  at para. 59, it is well  established that the protected 
characteristic does not need to be the only factor in the adverse impact.  It is sufficient that 
the protected characteristic was “a factor” in the adverse treatment.  All that is required is 
that there be a “connection” between the adverse treatment and the ground of 
discrimination.  
Circumstantial Evidence  
[21] The Tribunal has clarified that it is not uncommon for there to be no direct evidence 
that a prohibited ground was relied upon by an employer in an employment discrimination 
case. For example, in  Blakely  v Queen’s University, 2012 HRTO 1177 , at para  40 
(“Blakely ”) the Tribunal explains that:  
It is not at all unusual that cases alleging discrimination in relation to a 
hiring  decision proceed on the basis of circumstantial evidence, as 
2023 HRTO 376 (CanLII)
  
 8 applicants generally are not privy to the discussions held by the persons 
who made the hiring decision and as it is not uncommon that unstated and 
sometimes even unconscious biases may affect a hiring decision.  
[22] Because this need to consider the contextual evidence from the res pondent’s 
witnesses is significant to determining the legal issue where the respondent’s evidence 
has been heard, the Tribunal has explained that a one -step circumstantial evidence test 
may be more appropriate, as  described in  Blakely , at paras.  48-50:  
… in circumstantial evidence cases where the respondent’s evidence has 
been heard, the test should simply be whether the evidence is sufficient to 
satisfy the adjudicator that discrimination on the ground alleged is more 
probable than the explanations provid ed by the respondent, bearing in mind 
that the onus of proving discrimination always rests with the applicant and 
that discrimination need only be one factor in the respondent’s decision.

[23] As stated in  Lannin v. Ontario (Ministry of the Solicitor General) , 1993 CanLII 
16448  (ON HRT) and followed in  Clennon v. Toronto East General Hospital , 2009 HRTO 
1242  at para  103,  
… a finding of discrimination on the basis of circumstantial evidence will be 
made where the inference of discrimination is more probable from  the 
evidence than the actual explanation offered by the respondent, rather than 
“any other rational explanation”.  
[24] In this matter, both parties presented their cases, and this decision is based on the 
totality of the evidence presented.  
Duty to Accommodate  
[25] The duty to accommodate is a co -operative and collaborative process. 
See Chappell v. Securitas Canada Limited , 2012 HRTO 874 , at para.  27, and  Daykin v. 
Ford Motor Company of Canada , 2014 HRTO 319 , at para.  32, where the Tribunal stated:  
At the outset I note that jurisprudence regarding the duty to accommodate 
clearly establishes that all parties to the accommodation process have 
obligations. An individual seeking accommodation, for example, is 
responsible for initiating the process by sta ting the need for 
accommodation. The duty to accommodate is a cooperative duty and 
2023 HRTO 376 (CanLII)  
 9 requires the applicant, who is seeking accommodation, to provide sufficient 
information to allow the respondents to understand the nature of the 
disability. The duty to acco mmodate would require, at the least, the party 
seeking accommodation to act in a reasonable and cooperative manner. 
See for example,  Matthews v. Chrysler Canada Inc. , 2011 HRTO 1939  and 
Simpson v. Commissionaires (Great Lakes) , 2009 HRTO 1362 . 
[26] The responde nt ha s both procedural and substantive obligations.  Procedurally, the 
respondent ha s an obligation to take the necessary steps to determine what kinds of 
modifications or accommodations might be required  and how accommodation might be 
achieved . The substan tive duty requires the respondent to provide appropriate 
accommodation measures up to the point of undue hardship ( Taite v. Carleton 
Condominium Corporation No. 91, 2014 HRTO 165).  
[27]  Communication is an essential part of the accommodation process. Where a 
respondent is unaware of and has no reason to be aware of an accommodation need, 
there will not be a finding of liability. See  Macanovic v. Toronto Public Library , 2014 HRTO 
1592 , at paras . 10-16. 
[28]  In certain circumstances where an individual has not expressly made their 
disability needs known, there may nonetheless be a duty on a respondent to inquire 
further. In  Sears v. Honda of Canada Mfg. , 2014 HRTO 45  at para . 128, the Tribunal 
stated:  
… the procedural duty to accommodate, including the duty to inquire into 
the situation of the person needing accommodation, can arise without a 
specific request for accommodation by the individual i n circumstances in 
which there is reason to believe that the individual is having difficulty in an 
area included in Part 1, because of personal characteristics protected by 
the Code . … 
[29]  Though a respondent may have a duty to inquire even where there has not been 
a specific accommodation request, this duty has generally only arisen in situations where 
the respondent should have been aware that an accommodation may be required from 
the circumstances. See  Wall v. Lippé Group , 2008 HRTO 50, at para . 80. 
2023 HRTO 376 (CanLII)
  
 10 Reprisal  
[30] The Code  defines reprisal in s. 8 as follows:  
Every person has a right to claim and enforce his or her rights under this 
Act, to institute and participate in proceedings under this Act and to refuse 
to infringe a right of another person under this Act, without reprisal or threat 
of reprisal for so doing.   
[31] To establish reprisal, an applicant must establish that the respondent engaged in 
an action or threat wh ich was intended as a retaliation for claiming or enforcement of a 
right under the Code .

[30] The Code  defines reprisal in s. 8 as follows:  
Every person has a right to claim and enforce his or her rights under this 
Act, to institute and participate in proceedings under this Act and to refuse 
to infringe a right of another person under this Act, without reprisal or threat 
of reprisal for so doing.   
[31] To establish reprisal, an applicant must establish that the respondent engaged in 
an action or threat wh ich was intended as a retaliation for claiming or enforcement of a 
right under the Code . Unlike an allegation of discrimination, where intention is not a 
necessary element to prove a violation, where reprisal is alleged, the applicant must 
establish that t he action was taken with an intent to punish or retaliate.   
[32] As the Tribunal set out in Noble v. York University,  2010 HRTO 878, in an 
allegation of reprisal, the following elements must be established, namely (a) an action 
taken against, or threat made to, the applicant, (b) the alleged action or threat is related 
to the applicant having claimed or attempted to enfo rce her right under the Code ; and (c) 
an intention on the part of the respondent to retaliate for the claim or attempt to enforce 
the right.  
BACKGROUND FACTS AND  CHRONOLOGY  
[33] The following facts are based on the Agreed Statement of Facts, witnesses’ 
testimon y and the documentary evidence.  These facts are substantially not in dispute, 
unless otherwise noted.  Where evidence is in dispute it is discussed.  I am referring  only 
to what is relevant and essential to my findings in the disposition of the legal issues.  
[34] The applicant had been employed by the respondent as a warehouse support 
representative since August 5, 2014.  His duties included supervision of two other 
warehouse support representatives, each of whom had less seniority than the applicant.  
[35] The respondent wa s, among other things,  a supplier of power tools  to industrial 
and building renovation markets.  
2023 HRTO 376 (CanLII)  
 11 [36] Several years prior to the commencement of his employment with the respondent, 
the applicant’s spouse suffered an injury  and had ongoing medical needs.  This was 
known by the respondent at the time of the applicant’s hiring.  
[37] The applicant requested accommodation from the respondent to attend to his 
spouse ’s medical needs by way of being permitted to leave work two hours earl y every 
Wednesday.  This r equest was granted and remained in place continuously  until the 
applicant’s termination from employment on January 19, 2018.  
[38] No evidence was presented to suggest that this long -standing accommodation was 
an issue in the employment relationship  or that it gave rise to any resentment, on the part 
of the respondent, in granting this accommodation.  
[39] In late October  or early November 2017,  the applicant asked for a raise . All 
employees of the respondent , including the applicant, received  a 2.5% increase effectiv e 
January 1, 2018.  However,  the applicant was denied his request for an additional 
increase . 
[40] On November 27, 2017,  the applicant was involved in a slow -speed motor vehicle 
accident , when he was struck from the rear while exiting a parking lot.  In his evidence , 
the applicant acknowledged that  in the accident the airbags did not deploy, there was no 
loss of consciousness , he was able to exit the vehicle independently and that police and 
emergency medical services were  not present at the scene.   
[41] On Novemb er 28, 2017,  the applicant notified McGrattan that he had been involved 
in a motor vehicle accident . When asked if he was “okay” the applicant indicated that he 
was fine and reported to work later that same day. This was not disputed by the applicant.  
[42] The applicant did inform the respondent that he would need some time off to attend  
medical appointments which request was accommodated.  This was not disputed by the 
applicant.

[42] The applicant did inform the respondent that he would need some time off to attend  
medical appointments which request was accommodated.  This was not disputed by the 
applicant.  
[43]  McGrattan, in her evidence, stated that other than the initial one -half day from 
work , the applicant did not miss any additional workdays  after November 28, 2017,  until 
2023 HRTO 376 (CanLII)  
 12 his termination on January 19, 2018  (the “relevant accommodation period”).  This was not 
challenged by the applicant.  
[44] In his evidence , the applicant acknowledged that he  did not specifically request 
from the respondent any additional accommodation to address injuries from the motor 
vehicle accident. It was his evidence that in his capacity as a supervising warehouse 
support representative , he was able to assign himself modified duties commensurate with 
his physical abilities. T he applicant acknowledged that the respondent “ implicitly  
consented” to this.  Further t he applicant , in the A pplication , acknowledged that in the 
following weeks “all of the work was  done comp etently and in a timely fashion”.   
[45] On January 1 9, 2018,  the applicant was informed by Claessens and McGratten 
that he was being terminated.  He alleges and the respondent disputes that during the 
termination meeting , he was told that he would now have time to take care of his disabled 
wife, more time to look after my own recovery from injuries due to the motor vehicle 
accident  and time to seek a job more in line with his expectations for remuneration.  
[46] Upon terminatio n, the applicant received $2,282.10 as pay in lieu of notice and 
$1,981.33 as severance for a total of $4,26 3.43. 
Medical Evidence of Disability and Disability  Related Needs  
[47] The only medical evidence presented during the hearing consisted of  an undated, 
“To whom this may concern” note from Physiomed  and an insurer examination  report 
from Dr. El -Sherbini dated August 8, 2018  (“Sherbini Report”).  
[48] The Physiomed note was undated but references the applicant having undergone 
an MRI scan which occurred on March 5, 2018 .  
[49] Accordingly,  both the Physiomed note,  and the Sherbini Report did not exist at the 
time of the applicant’s termination on January 19, 2018  and were never provided to the 
respondent . As such their content could not have been a factor in the termin ation of the 
applicant’s employment.  
2023 HRTO 376 (CanLII)  
 13 [50] No medical evidence was produced by the applicant  relating to what, if any, 
medical treatment  or accommodations  he may have required  during the  relevant 
accommodation period.  
[51] The Sherbini Report does  comment that one day after the motor vehicle accident , 
the applicant did visit his family doctor , who prescribed pain medication and a muscle 
relaxant but that no investigations were order ed.  
FINDINGS AND ANALYSI S 
Did the Respondent Discriminate Against the Applicant with Respect to 
Employment by Failing to Provide Reasonable Accommodation to the Applicant 
in Relation to the Applicant’s Disability Related Needs During the  Relevant 
Accommodation Period?  
[52] There is no dispute that the applicant was involved in a motor vehicle accident on 
November 27, 2017. The applicant’s description to the respondent  suggested a minor 
collision in a parking lot.

[51] The Sherbini Report does  comment that one day after the motor vehicle accident ,

FINDINGS AND ANALYSI S 
Did the Respondent Discriminate Against the Applicant with Respect to 
Employment by Failing to Provide Reasonable Accommodation to the Applicant 
in Relation to the Applicant’s Disability Related Needs During the  Relevant 
Accommodation Period?  
[52] There is no dispute that the applicant was involved in a motor vehicle accident on 
November 27, 2017. The applicant’s description to the respondent  suggested a minor 
collision in a parking lot.  Accommodations were provided by way of time off to attend 
medi cal appointments an d as a supervising warehouse support representative  implicit 
approval  to assign himself modified duties.   
[53] These accommodations remained in place throughout the relevant 
accommodation period  during which  “all work was done competently and in a timely 
fashion”.   
[54] No evidence was presented to suggest that at any time prior to the ap plicant’s 
termination did he inform the respondent that he had additional disability related  
accommodation needs.  
[55] If the applicant had any additional disability related accommodation needs , these 
were not brought to the respondent’s attention.  
[56] Moreover,  there was no evidence to suggest that during the relevant 
accommodation period , the respondent  had any reason to believe that the applicant had 
2023 HRTO 376 (CanLII)  
 14 any additional disability related accommodation needs.  The applicant acknowledged that 
during this time period  “all of the work was done competently and in a timely fashion” and 
no medical or other evidence was presented to suggest any difficulty  by the applicant in 
performing his duties.   
[57] In all the circumstances , I find that the applicant  has not satisfied the legal burden 
of proof of establishing on a balance of probabilities that the respondent failed to provide 
reasonable accommodations during the relevant accommodation period  because there 
was no evidence of either a request for accommodation or any reason triggering a duty 
for the respondent to in quire into whether accommodation might be needed . 
Did the Respondent Discriminate Against the Applicant with Respect to 
Employment Because of Family Status when it  Terminated the Applicant’s 
Employment ? 
[58] Throughout the applicant’s employment with the respondent, he had been 
provided with accommodations in relation to  his family status need ed to assist his spouse 
with her medical needs by way of being permitted to leave work two hours early every 
Wednesday . No evidence was presented to suggest that this long -standing 
accommodation was an issue in the employm ent relationship,  and it remained in place  
continuously until the termination of the applicant’s employment .  
[59] The applicant alleges discrimination based on family status because of a singular 
comment , allegedly made by Claessens  at the time of termination , that the applicant 
would now have more time to spend with his wife.  The applicant takes the position that 
the Tribunal should infer from this singular comment that this ongoing accommodation 
need was a factor in the termination of his employment.   
[60] Claesse ns disputes having made any comment to the applicant during the 
termination meeting in relation to the applicant’s spouse.   
[61] I do not need to make any factual determination on this issue . 
2023 HRTO 376 (CanLII)  
 15 [62] Even if made, i n my opinion , the inference  proposed by the applicant is not 
reasonable or warranted.  Given the long -standing nature of the family status 
accommodation, any such comment if made, is more consistent with  an attempt to soften 
the blow of termination.   
[63] In all the circumstances , I find that the applicant has not satisfied the legal burden 
of establishing on a balance of probabilities that  the applicant’s family status was a factor 
in the termination of the applicant’s employment.

 15 [62] Even if made, i n my opinion , the inference  proposed by the applicant is not

[63] In all the circumstances , I find that the applicant has not satisfied the legal burden

in the termination of the applicant’s employment.  
Did the Respondent Discriminat e Against the Applicant with  Respect to 
Employment Because of Disability When it Terminated his Employment ? 
[64] It is clear from the evidence  that during the relevant accommodation period , the 
applicant’s disability related accommodation needs were minimal.  They consisted of a 
need to take time off work to attend medical appointments (which appears to have been 
rare) and  the respondent permitting the applicant to delegate some task s. This 
accommodation continued, with out objection, until terminatio n, approximately two months 
after the m otor vehicle accident.  Further , there was no evidence of any  objections or 
resentment on the part of the respondent in regards to this ongoi ng accommodation.  
[65] The respondent ’s evidence was that the termination arose for legitimate non -
discriminatory reasons.  Specifically,  it was the position of the respondent that throughout 
the applicant’s employment , he had displayed difficulties in his communication with co-
workers, including those that he supervised.  Heated arguments ensued for which 
intervention was required.  Several  co-workers had  complained about the applicant’s 
conduct.  One co -worker had spoken of resigning his position if the situation was not 
addressed.  One such argument occurred the day before the termination.  
[66] It was the respondent’s position that they had informally spoken to the applicant  
on several occasions regarding his attitude and communication issues  but saw no 
improvement.   
2023 HRTO 376 (CanLII)  
 16 [67] The respondent also noted an incident , in December 2017, approximately one 
month prior to the terminatio n, where they allege that the applicant had damage d 
inventory . There was conflicting evidence on how the inventory was damaged . 
[68] In written submissions , the applicant acknowledged that his approach to the 
challenges of his supervisory role  may have led to s ome direct differences of opinion with 
colleagues . However,  the applicant takes the position that whatever his employment 
difficulties , he was not deserving of termination.  He was never provided written  
performance evaluations or written reprimands.   
[69] The respondent acknowledged that it was a small operation which had operated  
in a family -style that did not keep rigorous records and had no formal evaluation process.  
The applicant essentially acknowledged this to be tru e and that if issues existed,  they 
were dealt with informally.   
[70] Ultimately , the absence of a formal disciplinary process is not significant.  Each of 
the respondent’s witnesses and the applicant himself  testified to the informal nature of 
the respondent’s human resources.  Each of the respondent’s witness es spoke of the 
applicant’s communication issues  and while the applicant’s position is that these 
difficulties did not justify termination , he did acknowledge “some direct differences of 
opinion s with colleagues”.   
[71] This Tribunal does no t need to determine whether the termination of the applicant’s 
employment was justified or not.  As noted,  the applicant withdrew all allegations or claims 
relating to any wrongful dismissal allegations , in light of this Tribunal’s jurisdiction . 
[72] The only is sue is whether  the applicant has established on a balance of 
probabilities  that his disability was a factor in the termination of his employment. I find that 
the applicant has not met th is burden. Any disability related accommodation needs were 
minimal.  Accommodations were provided for almost two months without any impact on 
the employment relationship.

applicant’s employment.  
Did the Respondent’s Conduct Toward the Applicant Amount to Reprisal 
Contrary to the Code ?  
[74] The applicant alleges that his termination was an act of reprisal for him having 
coincidentally  asked for a pay raise and also needing increased accommodation for his 
motor vehicle accident injuries as well as accommodation needed to address his family 
status issues.  
[75] The applicant’s claim of reprisal , based on hi m having requested and been denied 
a raise , must fail as a matter of law.  Requesting a raise is not an attempt to claim or 
enforce a right under the Code . 
[76] Throughout his employment , the applicant’s request for a ccommodation to 
address his family status and the request for accommodation to address any motor 
vehicle related disability needs were granted . At the time of the termination , there was no 
evidence to suggest that additional disability related accommodation needs would arise.  
There is no factual basis  from which to conclude that the respondent had any intention to 
reprise against the applicant  in relation to his prior accommodation requests.   
[77] I find that the applicant has not proven on a balance of probabilities that the 
respondent’s conduct amounts to reprisal under the Code .

)2009 HRTO 877 (CanLII) INTRODUCTION 
[1] This is the Decision with respect to an Application filed under s. 53(3) of the 
Human Rights Code, R.S.O. 1990, c.H-19, as amended (the “Code”).  The complaint 
which underlies the current Application was filed with the Ontario Human Rights 
Commission on July 11, 2005 and abandoned upon the filing of the present Application 
with the Tribunal on November 13, 2008. 
[2] A Case Resolution Conference (“CRC”) was held on June 4, 2009 in accordance 
with the expectation, expressed in theCodeand the Tribunal’s Rules, that section 53(3)
applications proceed in a highly expeditious manner.  I heard from the applicant, the 
respondent Michael Shaw, and the respondents’ witnesses Diane Noto, Bruce Finlay 
and Hanna Katz (by telephone). 
[3] The applicant, who self-identifies as African Canadian, alleges that the
respondent Michael Shaw, a police constable, discriminated against him on the basis of 
race and colour when he stopped and questioned the applicant on March 9, 2005.  The 
other named respondents are the Toronto Police Services Board (“TPSB”) and William 
Blair, Chief of Police. 
[4] I find that Michael Shaw did discriminate against the applicant on March 9, 2005 
in the provision of police services on the basis of colour, contrary to section 1 and 9 of 
the Code.  
[5] The parties agreed to bifurcate this proceeding. The issue of remedy and the
liability of the TPSB and William Blair will be heard on the next day of hearing. 
Chronology of Events 
[6] The following events are not in dispute, except where I specifically note, by using 
words such as alleged, or asserted, or otherwise indicate a contested point. 
[7] On March 9, 2005, the applicant in his capacity of a relief letter carrier employed by 2009 HRTO 877 (CanLII) 2 Canada Post was delivering mail in the area of the Bridle Path, which is a well known
affluent neighbourhood in Toronto.  It was his second day delivering mail on that route. 
He was wearing the Canada Post coat, carrying a mail satchel, and delivering regular 
mail and flyers.  He did not stop at every house as there was no mail for some houses 
and other houses had a “no flyer” notation.   
[8] That day, Michael Shaw, a police constable who had served in the area for 
several years was training a new police constable, Diane Noto.  At the start of their shift 
they were given a Directed Patrol Assignment, recommending that they patrol the area 
where the applicant was delivering mail between 12 p.m. and 4.00 p.m.  The 
assignment details were that phone lines had been cut in the area by suspects 
described as Male, White and East European, who were using a vehicle.     
[9] Constable Shaw decided to patrol the identified area that morning, in accordance 
with the Directed Patrol Assignment.

He did not stop at every house as there was no mail for some houses 
and other houses had a “no flyer” notation.   
[8] That day, Michael Shaw, a police constable who had served in the area for 
several years was training a new police constable, Diane Noto.  At the start of their shift 
they were given a Directed Patrol Assignment, recommending that they patrol the area 
where the applicant was delivering mail between 12 p.m. and 4.00 p.m.  The 
assignment details were that phone lines had been cut in the area by suspects 
described as Male, White and East European, who were using a vehicle.     
[9] Constable Shaw decided to patrol the identified area that morning, in accordance 
with the Directed Patrol Assignment.  As the police car turned from Farrington Drive 
onto Vernham Avenue, Constable Shaw allegedly immediately pointed out a figure at 
the other end of Vernham Avenue as engaged in potentially unusual activity, walking in 
the middle of the street and then crossing back and forth.  It was the applicant although 
at that distance Constables Shaw and Noto assert that they were unable to discern the
gender or the skin colour of the person.  As the applicant approached, they could 
discern that he was an African Canadian male, wearing a Canada Post jacket and 
carrying material in his hand.  Constable Shaw asserts that he realized that this was not 
the usual letter carrier and that he was not stopping to deliver mail at every house.  
[10] Constable Noto drove the police car at a slow pace along Vernham Avenue, 
keeping the applicant in view.  They followed him to the corner of Vernham Avenue and 
Vernham Court where the applicant went up to a house, knocked on the door, and 
spoke to the woman who answered.  They did not see him deliver anything, which they 
thought unusual.  Constable Shaw instructed Constable Noto to inquire of the resident 
why the applicant had knocked.  Constable Noto spoke to the resident, Hanna Katz, 
who advised that the applicant had stopped to advise her that he had misdelivered 
something.2009 HRTO 877 (CanLII) 3 [11] Constable Noto advised Constable Shaw of this information. Constable Shaw
found this suspicious.  Accordingly, they drove up Vernham Court and stopped the 
applicant. 
[12] They asked him for identification.  The applicant willingly and politely provided his 
driver’s licence and his Canada Post identification. Constable Noto returned to the
police vehicle and performed a check which revealed nothing.  Constable Noto advised 
of the results and after some conversation, the manner and content of which is 
disputed, the police entered their car and departed to continue patrolling the area. 
[13] Shortly after this, they encountered another letter carrier Bruce Finlay at a relay
box picking up mail and Constable Shaw recognized him as the regular carrier on a 
nearby route.  Constable Shaw asked Mr. Finlay about the letter carrier in the Vernham 
Avenue area.  Mr. Finlay stated that he was a male, White about 35 years of age.  
Constable Shaw inquired about other potential letter carriers in the area and Mr. Finlay 
stated that there was a temporary carrier, a “Black man”, in the area.  The police drove 
on.   
[14] The applicant subsequently hailed the police officers to inquire why they had 
stopped him.  A conversation ensued, the contents of which are disputed. 
[15] The applicant believed that the police officers’ decision to stop and question him 
was because of his skin colour and he testified that he was upset, dazed and in shock.  
While continuing on his route that day, he noted that a White male delivering water in 
the area was not questioned.  He stopped at three construction sites where there were 
White workers and asked them if any of them had been stopped by the police.  None of 
them had been.  This is not disputed by the respondents.  The applicant also met up 
with Mr. Finlay that morning and learned that the police had questioned him (Finlay) 
about the letter carriers in the area.

Analysis and Conclusions 
[16] The relevant principles that apply in cases where an allegation of racial 2009 HRTO 877 (CanLII) 4 discrimination has been raised have been usefully summarized as follows:
(a) The prohibited ground or grounds of discrimination need not be the 
sole or the major factor leading to the discriminatory conduct; it is 
sufficient if they are a factor; 
(b) There is no need to establish an intention or motivation to 
discriminate; the focus of the enquiry is on the effect of the respondent's 
actions on the complainant; 
(c) The prohibited ground or grounds need not be the cause of the 
respondent's discriminatory conduct; it is sufficient if they are a factor or 
operative element; 
(d) There need be no direct evidence of discrimination; discrimination 
will more often be proven by circumstantial evidence and inference; and 
(e) Racial stereotyping will usually be the result of subtle unconscious 
beliefs, biases and prejudices. 
Radek v. Henderson Development (Canada) Ltd. (No. 3) (2005), 52 
C.H.R.R. D/430, 2005 BCHRT 302 at para. 482; Pritchard v. Ziedler (2007), 
CHRR Doc. 07-527 (Sask. H.R.T.). 
[17] In this case, as in many cases alleging racial discrimination, there is no direct 
evidence that race was a factor in the officer’s decision to take the actions that he did.  
As a result, the issue of whether the officer’s actions amount to racial discrimination in 
violation of the Codefalls to be determined in accordance with the following well-
established principles applicable to circumstantial evidence cases. 
1) Once a prima facie case of discrimination has been established, the 
burden shifts to the respondent to provide a rational explanation which is 
not discriminatory. 
2) It is not sufficient to rebut an inference of discrimination that the 
respondent is able to suggest just any rational alternative explanation. The 
respondent must offer an explanation which is credible on all the
evidence. 
3) A complainant is not required to establish that the respondent’s
actions lead to no other conclusion but that discrimination was the basis 
for the decision at issue in a given case. 2009 HRTO 877 (CanLII) 5 4) There is no requirement that the respondents' conduct, to be found
discriminatory, must be consistent with the allegation of discrimination and 
inconsistent with any other rational explanation. 
5) The ultimate issue is whether an inference of discrimination is more 
probable from the evidence than the actual explanations offered by the 
respondent. 
[18] In determining whether the inference of racial discrimination is more probable 
than the explanations offered by the respondent officer, I also need to be mindful of the 
nature of racial discrimination as it is understood today and that it will often be the 
product of learned attitudes and biases and often operates on an unconscious level: 
Nassiah v. Peel (Regional Municipality) Services Board,2007 HRTO 14 (CanLII).
[19] Courts in Canada have accepted that racial profiling by police occurs in Canada 
and have indicated their willingness to scrutinize seemingly “neutral” police behaviour to 
assess whether it falls within the phenomenon of racial profiling.  In R. v. Brown (2003)

assess whether it falls within the phenomenon of racial profiling.  In R. v. Brown (2003) 
64 O.R. (3) 161 (Ont. CA) at para. 9, Morden J. A. stated that the Crown’s concession
that the phenomenon of racial profiling existed was “a responsible position to take 
because…this conclusion is supported by significant social science research”.  InPeart 
v. Peel Regional Police Service Board, [2206] O.J. NO. 4456 (Ont CA), Doherty J.A. 
stated the “racial profiling occurs and is a day-to-day reality in the lives of those 
minorities affected by it.” 
[20] There is no dispute that Constable Shaw, the senior police constable, directed 
the day’s events.  The issue for me to determine is whether the applicant’s skin colour 
was a factor in Constable Shaw’s surveillance of, decision to stop, and subsequent 
inquiry about the applicant.   
[21] Constables Shaw and Noto testified that the applicant’s skin colour was not a 
factor in their actions and was not discussed between them.  I accept their evidence that 
the applicant’s skin colour was not discussed between them.  However, I find that on a 
balance of probabilities, the fact that the applicant was an African Canadian in an 
affluent neighbourhood was a factor, a significant factor, and probably the predominant 
factor, whether consciously or unconsciously, in Constable Shaw’s actions.  2009 HRTO 877 (CanLII) 6 [22] Constable Shaw testified that a number of unusual features, including the
applicant’s behaviour, influenced his actions.  The features he asserted were unusual 
are these: the applicant was not the usual letter carrier, the applicant was crossing back 
and forth across the street, and the applicant did not stop at every house.  These three 
factors caused Constable Shaw to survey the applicant.  His suspicion was further 
fostered by the applicant’s knocking on the door of a house but not delivering any mail 
augmented by the excuse, as reported by the resident, that he had misdelivered some 
material.  However, after conducting a police check and asking the applicant some 
questions, Constable Shaw testified that he was completely satisfied that the applicant
was a legitimate letter carrier.  Constable Shaw testified that his further inquiries of 
Mr. Finlay at the relay box about letter carriers in the area was in the nature of a training 
exercise for Constable Noto to teach her that there were various ways to obtain 
confirming information. 
[23] In my view, the above chronology, as described by the respondent Shaw is more 
consistent with a finding that the applicant’s skin colour played a role in his actions than 
the applicant’s alleged unusual activity. 
[24] First, the fact that the applicant was not the usual letter White male letter carrier
is surely not a suspicious circumstance.  Letter carriers take vacation, retire, and/or 
switch routes, so the fact that another letter carrier was delivering the mail on that 
particular day cannot explain Constable Shaw’s heightened alertness.  I find significant 
that he did not respond in a similar way to an unfamiliar White male delivering water in 
the area. 
[25] Second, Constable Noto testified that immediately upon turning onto Vernham 
Avenue, Constable Shaw pointed out the applicant as a person of note.  It is not likely 
that Constable Shaw had already noticed the applicant’s alleged crossing back and 
forth across the street in an unusual manner as soon as they turned the corner.

[25] Second, Constable Noto testified that immediately upon turning onto Vernham 
Avenue, Constable Shaw pointed out the applicant as a person of note.  It is not likely 
that Constable Shaw had already noticed the applicant’s alleged crossing back and 
forth across the street in an unusual manner as soon as they turned the corner.  
Whether or not Constables Shaw and Noto noticed a figure in the distance when they 
turned onto Vernham Avenue, I do not accept their evidence that the figure was 
crossing back and forth across the street in an unusual manner.2009 HRTO 877 (CanLII) 7 [26] Third, it is not in keeping with the preponderance of probabilities that the
applicant was constantly crossing back and forth across the street. The applicant could 
not recall whether or how often he crossed the street that day.  However, he testified 
and his evidence is in keeping with the preponderance of probabilities that while letter 
carriers usually deliver their mail on one side of the street and then the other, if they 
make a mistake in preparing their mail they might cross the street mid-street, 
occasionally.  Since there is no dispute that the applicant was, in fact, a legitimate letter 
carrier, either he made an unusual number of mistakes and crossed the street an 
extraordinary number of times on that day, or in the usual manner of letter carriers, he
may have crossed the street once or at most twice.  I do not accept Constable Shaw’s 
evidence as in keeping with the preponderance of probabilities that the applicant was 
crossing the street back and forth in an unusual fashion. 
[27] Fourth, Constable Shaw in his original response to the complaint, his will say
statement and his evidence at the hearing, noted the fact that the applicant did not stop 
at every house as an unusual circumstance.  However, the evidence of the applicant 
and Mr. Finlay was that it is not unusual for a letter carrier to skip houses if there is no 
mail to be delivered and the householder has asked not to have flyers delivered.  
Indeed, Constable Shaw conceded in cross examination by the applicant that he had in 
the past seen letter carriers skip houses.  In my view, it is in keeping with the 
preponderance of probabilities that Constable Shaw was well aware that letter carriers 
do not stop at every house.
[28] Accordingly, I conclude that it was not unusual behaviour on the applicant’s part 
that caused Constable Shaw to decide to place the applicant under surveillance but 
rather the fact that he was an African Canadian male in an affluent neighbourhood.  His 
suspicions were not alleviated by the Canada Post uniform, mailbag or mail delivery. It
is also noteworthy that the Directed Patrol Assignment related to suspicious persons in 
the neighbourhood with entirely different characteristics: White, Eastern European, 
using a vehicle. The fact that it was an African Canadian male without a vehicle that 
attracted Constable Shaw’s attention is what is unusual.  I am further reinforced in my
conclusions by Constable Shaw’s continued actions, described below.  2009 HRTO 877 (CanLII) 8 [29] Having decided to scrutinize the applicant, Constable Shaw found it suspicious
that the applicant knocked on a resident’s door and spoke to a woman but did not 
deliver any mail or flyers.  Mr. Finlay testified that it was not unusual to misdeliver mail 
and to go back and try to retrieve it, which is what the applicant did that day. 
Nonetheless, Constable Shaw found this to be suspicious behaviour and asked 
Constable Noto to ask the resident what the applicant had been doing.  Constable Noto 
testified Ms. Katz advised her that the applicant said he had misdelivered something.  
[30] Ms. Katz testified that she could barely recall the events of that day.

2009 HRTO 877 (CanLII) 8 [29] Having decided to scrutinize the applicant, Constable Shaw found it suspicious

Nonetheless, Constable Shaw found this to be suspicious behaviour and asked 
Constable Noto to ask the resident what the applicant had been doing.  Constable Noto 
testified Ms. Katz advised her that the applicant said he had misdelivered something.  
[30] Ms. Katz testified that she could barely recall the events of that day. However, 
she did call Canada Post that day to report the events and she agreed that the Canada 
Post report was likely accurate and that she was the only source of information on the 
Canada Post report.  Her report to Canada Post was that she told the police that the 
applicant had come to retrieve misdelivered mail.  Had Constable Noto inquired, she 
would undoubtedly have learned that Ms. Katz had in fact received misdelivered mail
the previous day, that she had delivered it to the correct address, and that she had told 
the applicant that.  Constable Noto apparently did not learn this as she immediately 
returned to Constable Shaw with the information that the applicant had said he knocked 
on the door to inquire about a misdelivery.  Constable Shaw concluded that this was 
suspicious behaviour, as it was not unknown for criminals to disguise themselves with 
legitimate uniforms and check out houses with false explanations.  In my view, but for 
Constable Shaw’s improperly heightened suspicion of the applicant, he would not have 
found the applicant’s alleged misdelivery suspicious.
[31] Accordingly, I conclude that the applicant’s colour was a factor in Constable 
Shaw’s continued suspicion of the applicant and his decision to stop and question the 
applicant.  
[32] After being provided with the applicant’s driver’s license and Canada Post 
identification and having ascertained that the applicant had no police record or other 
suspicious notations on his record, Constable Shaw nonetheless proceeded to question 
another letter carrier, Mr. Finlay, about the letter carriers in the neighbourhood.  Only 
after Mr. Finlay identified a "Black man” who was acting as a temporary letter carrier did2009 HRTO 877 (CanLII) 9 Constable Shaw cease his inquiries. I reject Constable Shaw’s explanation that he was
trying to teach Constable Noto about alternative ways to complete an investigation and 
find instead that Constable Shaw’s heightened scrutiny of the applicant was continuing. 
[33] I emphasize that although I have rejected each of Constable Shaw’s explanations 
as not consistent with the preponderance of probabilities, the combination of his actions
when viewed together further supports my conclusions.  
[34] I conclude that the applicant’s colour was a factor in Constable Shaw’s 
surveillance, decision to stop, and subsequent inquiries about the applicant on March 9, 
2005 and that he breached the applicant’s right to equal treatment without
discrimination on the basis of colour with respect to services, contrary to sections 1 and 
9 of the Code.
[35] I stated earlier that there were disputes between the parties with respect to the 
manner and content of the two conversations between the applicant and the officers. I
find that it is necessary to make some findings on these matters as they may affect the 
remedial aspect of the case.  The applicant asserted that the officers drove abruptly into 
a driveway that he was about to cross and approached him in an intimidating manner. 
The first word Constable Shaw uttered, in a disrespectful manner, was “ID.”  When he 
asked why they wanted his identification, Constable Shaw answered in an insulting 
manner, “I would ask even if you were the Prime Minister of Canada.” The police check 
took a considerable period of time during which the applicant asked to continue 
delivering mail and the police car followed him while he was doing so.
[36] This is denied by the officers.  They testified that they stopped on the curb and 
did not pull into the driveway because of rules against entering unnecessarily upon 
private property.

police check, Constable Shaw inquired why the applicant had not delivered pamphlets 
to every home.  Upon being advised by the applicant that not everyone wanted 
pamphlets, and upon receiving the negative results from the police check, Constable 2009 HRTO 877 (CanLII) 10 Shaw apologized for stopping him. They deny following him in the police car while they
did the check.  
[37] I accept the applicant’s evidence that he felt intimidated by being approached by 
two police officers, wearing guns, one of whom, Constable Shaw, is a very large man.  I 
note that the applicant has a small stature. I also accept that he perceived that the
officers did not treat him respectfully.  However, I am not persuaded on a balance of 
probabilities that Constable Shaw used the police vehicle in an intimidating manner, that 
he approached the applicant in an intimidating manner or that he spoke rudely to the 
applicant.  
[38] The applicant did not give any detailed testimony about the second meeting after 
he hailed the officers and asked why they had stopped him, and therefore it is 
unnecessary to make any findings of fact about the manner in which he was treated at 
that time.

 3 [1] This Application , filed March 29, 2018, alleges discrimination  due to  disability with 
respect to employment and alleges reprisal  contrary to the Human Rights Code , R.S.O. 
1990, c . H.19, as amended (the “Code ”). Among other things, the applicant  seeks 
financial co mpensation.  
[2] This Application was deferred pending the completion of a civil matter relating to 
the applicant’s employment at the respondent.  
[3] The civil matter was completed and the Tribunal re -activated this Application in 
Yang v. Maple Leaf Foods Inc. , 2019 HRTO 916  (“Yang ”). 
[4] The Tribunal convened a preliminary hearing in order for the parties to provide 
their submissions on whether the Application should be dismissed on the basis that the 
substance of it has been appropriately dealt with by the civil proceeding, and whether it  
should be dismissed on the basis of section 34(11) of the Code.  
BACKGROUND  
[5] The applicant alleges that the respondent did not permit her to return to work after 
a medical leave, due to her disability, and that it subsequently terminated her due to 
disability. She also filed a Statement of Claim in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice 
(“the civil claim”) in which she raised many of the same factual allegations as are raised 
in thi s Application.  
[6] By way of remedy, she seeks the following:  
a. Damages for violations of the … Code… in the amount of $150,000;  
b. Back -pay from the date of the Applicant’s termination, including 
compensation for all employment -related benefits, with the option of 
reinstatement, in an amount to be determined at the hearing for this 
matter;  
c. Pre-judgment interest and post -judgment interest pursuant to the 
Courts of Justice Act… ; and  
2021 HRTO 246 (CanLII)  
 4 d. Any goods and services tax or harmonized sales tax payable on any 
amounts pursuant to t he Excise Tax Act… or any other legislation 
enacted by the Government of Canada or Ontario.   
 
The Application  
[7] In her Application, the applicant  stated that there had been no court action based 
on the same facts as the Application.  
[8] The applicant worked as a Senior Cost Analyst for the respondent from May 19, 
2015 to February 2, 2018.  
[9] In her Application, the applicant states that she was diagnosed with Transverse 
Myelitis and was off work due to this  disability from September 8, 2016  to March 6, 2017.  
She asserted that when she returned to work in March 2017, she required the assistance 
of a cane and a walker.  
[10] She states that due to stress she went off work again from September 27, 2017 to 
February 12, 2018. She alleges that her phy sician cleared her for a return to work, but 
that when she went back to work on February 12, 2018, she was told to leave the 
premises and not return to work until directed otherwise.

she had used it on her previous return to work, without any issue being raised by the 
respondent. On February 15, 2018, she emailed individuals at the respondent’s human 
resources department regarding the Accessibility for Ontarians Act (AODA ) to indicate 
that she was aware of protections provi ded by legislation.  
[14] She alleges that she received a phone call from an individual in the human 
resources department, confirming that her doctor had cleared her for a return to work.  
During that conversation, she asked why the respondent had told her disab ility case 
manager that she was not permitted to use a cane at work, but the individual from human 
resources did not provide her with any answer.  
[15] On February 17, 2018, she received a voicemail from the respondent regarding 
her return to work on February 20 , 2018. She alleges that she was nervous about being 
sent home again and emailed her supervisor and individuals in the human resources 
department, asking again why the disability case manager had been told that she could 
not use her cane at work, stating t hat she had used it when she returned to work in March 
2017 and informing them that she was aware of the AODA  and had documented the 
events of the past week. She asserts that the respondent did not answer her question.  
[16] She alleges that when she returned to  work on February 20, 2018, she was called 
into a meeting with her supervisor and others to discuss her February 17, 2018 email. 
She alleges that she asked why the respondent was making her return to work difficult, 
but that an individual from the human re sources department did not answer the question 
but began to argue with her. She alleges that her manager concluded the meeting by 
stating that he did not have time for her questions.  
[17] She alleges that on February 22, 2018, she was called into a meeting imme diately 
after arriving at work, and the respondent terminated her employment without giving her 
a reason.  
2021 HRTO 246 (CanLII)  
 6 [18] She alleges that the respondent discriminated against her due to her disability and 
that it terminated her employment due to the fact that she had adv ised them that she had 
been documenting events and knew of her protections under AODA.  
[19] The respondent denied the allegations of discrimination and reprisal and provided 
its version of events. It stated, among other things, that the termination of the applicant’s 
employment was unrelated to any Code -protected ground.  
The Civil Claim  
[20] In addit ion to filing  the Application with the Tribunal, the applicant filed the civil 
claim.

employment was unrelated to any Code -protected ground.  
The Civil Claim  
[20] In addit ion to filing  the Application with the Tribunal, the applicant filed the civil 
claim.  
[21] The Statement of Claim contained 18 paragraphs. In her Statement of Claim, she 
claims as follows:  
4. Erica began her employment with Maple Leaf on or about May 19, 2015 
pursuant to a written employment agreement as a Cost Analyst at the 
Cappola (LePage Court, Downsview) location.  
5. Throughout her employment, Erica was a hard -working and dedicated 
employee.  
6. In September 2016, Erica pleads that she was hospitalized sudd enly and 
diagnosed with Transverse Myelitis. As a result, Erica pleads that she had 
to take short -term disability leave.  
7. Erica pleads that she returned to work in March 2017, however she 
required the assistance of a walker and cane to function.  
8. In or  around October 2017, Erica again went on short -term disability. Her 
illness was caused by the stressful work environment at Maple Leaf. Erica 
returned to work in or around February 2018.  
9. On February 12, 2018, Erica was cleared by her physician and disa bility 
case manager to return to work. However, upon her arrival at Maple Leaf, 
she was immediately instructed by human resources to leave work and not 
return until advised otherwise.  
10. Erica was advised that human resources would advise her by the end 
of the day whether she was permitted to return to work the following day. 
2021 HRTO 246 (CanLII)  
 7 Notwithstanding this representation, the Defendant failed advise [sic] Erica 
of her status.  
11. After a discussion with her disability case manager and physician, Erica 
was cleared to  return to work on February 20, 2018. However, on February 
15, 2018, Erica’s case manager informed her that Maple Leaf’s benefit 
department had contacted him and advised that Erica could not return to 
work because her cane was not permitted in the plants.  
12. Erica returned to work on February 20, 2018, and on February 22, 2018, 
she was terminated from her employment without cause.  
13. Erica pleads that since she is not bound by an employment contract that 
limits her notice entitlements upon termination un der the Employment 
Standards Act… , or otherwise, she is entitled to reasonable notice of her 
termination at common law.  
14. At the time of her termination, Erica had been employed with Maple Leaf 
for 2 years, 9 months, was earning approximately $68,000.00 per year in 
remuneration and was 54 years of age.   
… 
15. In light of Erica’s specialized position, length of service, her age, 
disability, the current state of the economy, and the consequential scarcity 
of comparable employment in the marketplace, Erica is entitled to a period 
of reasonable notice of the termination of her employment of not less than 
12 months’ pay, or the sum of $68,000.00.

14. At the time of her termination, Erica had been employed with Maple Leaf 
for 2 years, 9 months, was earning approximately $68,000.00 per year in 
remuneration and was 54 years of age.   
… 
15. In light of Erica’s specialized position, length of service, her age, 
disability, the current state of the economy, and the consequential scarcity 
of comparable employment in the marketplace, Erica is entitled to a period 
of reasonable notice of the termination of her employment of not less than 
12 months’ pay, or the sum of $68,000.00.  
[22] In the civil claim, she sought the following:  
a. Damages for wrongful dismissal and breach of an employment contract 
in the sum of $68,000, representing 12 months ’ pay in lieu of notice;  
b. Damages equal to the value of employment related benefits over the 12 - 
month period including, without limitation, vacation pay, RRSP 
contributions, medical and any insurance coverage;  
c. Special damages equal to the costs incurred by the Plaintiff in seeking 
to obtain alternative employment in an amount to be proven at trial;  
d. The total amount claimed under paragraphs a) through c) not to exceed 
$1000,000.00 in compliance with Rule 76 and wa iving any amount above 
same;  
e. Prejudgement interest and post -judgment interest pursuant to the 
provisions of the Courts of Justice Act… ; 
2021 HRTO 246 (CanLII)  
 8 f. Any goods and services tax or harmonized sales tax payable on any 
amounts pursuant to the Excise Tax Act…. as amended or any other 
legislation enacted by the Government of Canada or the Government of 
Ontario;  
g. Costs of this action on a substantial indemnity basis; and  
h. Such further and other relief as this Honourable Court may deem just.  
[23] The respondent filed a Statement of De fence in response to the civil claim, denying 
the applicant’s claims in that forum also.  
[24] On October 3, 2018, counsel for the applicant in her civil claim and counsel for the 
respondent appeared before a justice of the Ontario Superior Court to address the  issue 
of whether the Action should be set down for summary judgment motion. The applicant 
offered to amend her claim to remove paragraphs 8, 9 and 10 from the Statement of 
Claim. She also agreed at that time to state in her claim for damages for wrongful 
dismissal, that she was citing her disability as a factor to be considered when assessing 
her future prospect of finding work, and to state that it was not related to any allegation of 
misconduct by the respondent.  
[25] In a Direction dated the same day , the judge noted the above -noted changes the 
applicant’s counsel indicated he would make. He commented “In short, the plaintiff seeks 
to reduce this action solely to the issue of damages for lack of sufficient notice of 
termination. She will pursue her claim for  damages relating to allegedly oppressive 
behaviour by Maple Leaf Foods before the Human Rights Tribunal”. He indicated he was 
satisfied that the “stripped down claim” would be amenable to summary judgement and 
ordered that it be set down for a one day sum mary judgement motion, later scheduled for 
March 26, 2019.  
[26] The respondent states that the applicant’s statement of claim in the civil claim was 
never formally amended.  
[27] The parties entered into Minutes of Settlement (MOS) on January 10, 2019.   
2021 HRTO 246 (CanLII)  
 9 Minutes of S ettlement  
[28] The parties signed MOS, agreeing, in part, as follows:  
1. The Plaintiff and the Defendant agree to the settlement of the Action in 
accordance with the terms of this Agreement.  The Plaintiff and the 
Defendant agree the settlement has been reached on the basis that it 
represents the Decision of the Court on the pleadings delivered in the Action 
as if the Motion for Summary Judgment had proceeded on March 26, 2019.   
The Parties’ Submissions  
[29] The respondent submits that this Application must be dismissed  pursuant to s. 
34(11).

[27] The parties entered into Minutes of Settlement (MOS) on January 10, 2019.   
2021 HRTO 246 (CanLII)  
 9 Minutes of S ettlement  
[28] The parties signed MOS, agreeing, in part, as follows:  
1. The Plaintiff and the Defendant agree to the settlement of the Action in 
accordance with the terms of this Agreement.  The Plaintiff and the 
Defendant agree the settlement has been reached on the basis that it 
represents the Decision of the Court on the pleadings delivered in the Action 
as if the Motion for Summary Judgment had proceeded on March 26, 2019.   
The Parties’ Submissions  
[29] The respondent submits that this Application must be dismissed  pursuant to s. 
34(11).  It submits that while the applicant did not specifically plead a violation of the Code 
in the civil claim, she did include the same factual allegations and sought damages 
specifically relating to her disability. The respondent subm its that she implicitly raised the 
Code and sought remedies for Code -related issues.  
[30] The respondent cites Ingram v. Cayne’s Super Housewares Incorporated , 2019 
HRTO 172 ( “Ingram ”) as an example of a case where the Tribunal found that  even if the 
court cla im does not explicit ly reference section 46.1 of the Code, s. 34(11) of the Code 
may still apply. It also cited Mauch v. J. Koo Family Healthycare Inc. , 2017 HRTO 67 
(“Mauch ”) in support of its submission that the applicant cannot avoid the application of 
s. 34(11) of the Code by subsequently withdrawing that portion of a civil action that raised 
a Code issue or by expressing an intention not to pursue a Code claim already plead ed 
in a civil action.   
[31] The respondent further submits that while the applicant did not explicitly plead a 
contravention of the Code in her civil claim, she included the same factual allegations as 
are in the Application and she sought damages specifically  relating to her disability in the 
context of the termination of her employment. The respondent submits therefore that she 
has implicitly raised the Code and sought remedies for Code -related issues.  
2021 HRTO 246 (CanLII)  
 10 [32] Last, the respondent submits that in the MOS the applican t agreed to settle the 
“entire Action, including the issues relating to the termination of her employment and any 
remedies resulting therefrom”. It submits that even with the amendments endorsed by the 
judge, the claim still included the same factual alleg ations regarding the circumstances of 
her employment and her termination, and sought remedies flowing from the termination 
of her employment. It submits that the parties agreed to resolve the issues concerning 
the termination of her employment, including t he issues of the appropriate remedies. It 
submits that in similar circumstances, the Tribunal held that an application was barred 
pursuant to section 34(11) of the Code.  
[33] The applicant submits that the allegations are serious and should be determined 
on the ir merits.  
[34] She submits that the civil action against the respondent was confined to a wrongful 
dismissal action  and she originally sought 12 months of damages “in lieu of notice” and 
that she settled for six months ’ notice. She submits that the civil clai m did not address the 
core issue in the application, being “whether the Respondent’s decision to terminate Ms.  
Yang’s employment was related to her disability”, a Code -protected ground. As such, her 
allegations of discrimination and the remedies she seeks were not pled in the civil claim 
and have not been addressed or even considered.   
[35] The applicant cites Pham v. Dimpflmeier Bakery Ltd. , 2018 HRTO 123 ( “Pham ”) 
and Rinaldi v . Paragon Security , 2017 HRTO 1370 ( “Rinaldi ”) which she says are 
examples of cases where dismissed employees in her position were allowed to bring a 
civil action and an Application at the Tribunal for discrimination.

[35] The applicant cites Pham v. Dimpflmeier Bakery Ltd. , 2018 HRTO 123 ( “Pham ”) 
and Rinaldi v . Paragon Security , 2017 HRTO 1370 ( “Rinaldi ”) which she says are 
examples of cases where dismissed employees in her position were allowed to bring a 
civil action and an Application at the Tribunal for discrimination. She states that in Pham, 
the Tribunal found that both are permitted “where the remedies and legal issues are 
sufficiently distinct, and there is no danger of inconsistent findings or duplicative 
remedies”.  
[36] She submits that the civil action was settled without any remedy for discrimination 
and without any finding regarding her allegation of discrimination. She submits that th e 
$150,000 she seeks at the Tribunal “for human rights damages and reinstatement”  would  
2021 HRTO 246 (CanLII)  
 11 not be duplicative of the six months ’ pay she received by way of settlement of the civil 
claim.  She states that with respect to her claim at the Tribunal for back -pay, should she 
be awarded back pay, she agrees she would not be entitled to back pay for the six month 
period represented by the  damages in lieu of notice she has received.   
[37] She submits that in her civil claim she did only sought damages for wrongful 
dismissal and that she did not allege discrimination, or claim monetary damages for 
human rights violations under section 46.1 of the Code. She submits that she sought no 
determin ation that the respondent discriminated against her on the basis of her disability 
while she was employed or at her termination.  
[38] She disputes the respondent’s assertion that the civil claim raises the same factual 
allegations as are in the Application. Sh e submits that the only determination the court 
was being asked to make was whether her employment was terminated with reasonable 
notice, and if not, what length of notice she was entitled to. To the extent that she 
mentioned her disability  in the civil cl aim, it was simply as a factor which should determine 
the appropriate length of notice awarded by the court. She submits that the Supreme 
Court has held that the health or disability or illness of a dismissed employee may be 
considered in determining the l ength of reasonable notice.   
[39] The applicant also submits that on the same day the judge released his 
endorsement, her lawyer sent a draft Amended Statement of Claim to counsel for the 
respondent, for him to discuss with his client, and stating that “this i s what we would be 
looking to amend the claim to”. She submits that paragraph 1 of the MOS, above, must 
be understood in the context of an Amended Statement of Claim which had been 
delivered to the respondent, though not filed with the Court. She also note s that she never 
signed a release in favour of the respondent.  
[40] She submits that applicants are permitted to split their cases between civil claims 
and applications at the Tribunal. She submits that s. 46.1 of the Code permits dismissed 
employees to claim wrongful dismissal before civil courts and to seek damages for Code 
breaches in their civil claim. She submits that while the Code does not permit an employee 
2021 HRTO 246 (CanLII)  
 12 to commence an action for wrongful dismissal which claims Code -based damages under 
s. 46.1 and al so commence an Application at the Tribunal for discrimination. She agrees 
that this would be prohibited by section 34(11) and 45.1 of the Code , as well as by the 
doctrine of abuse of process, but she submits that she has not made a claim for Code -
based damages in her civil claim. She submits that the type of “case splitting” which she 
has done is permitted.   
[41] She cites Beaver v Dr.

46.1 of the Code permits dismissed 
employees to claim wrongful dismissal before civil courts and to seek damages for Code 
breaches in their civil claim. She submits that while the Code does not permit an employee 
2021 HRTO 246 (CanLII)  
 12 to commence an action for wrongful dismissal which claims Code -based damages under 
s. 46.1 and al so commence an Application at the Tribunal for discrimination. She agrees

doctrine of abuse of process, but she submits that she has not made a claim for Code -
based damages in her civil claim. She submits that the type of “case splitting” which she 
has done is permitted.   
[41] She cites Beaver v Dr. Hans Epp Dentistry Professional Corporation , 2008 HRTO 
282 ( Beaver ), paragraphs 8 through 11, to say that 34(11) is only trigge red where a 
claimant makes a claim for Code damages under s. 46.1, or advances a claim for bad 
faith or punitive damages based on a violation of the Code. She asserts that she has 
made no such claim.  
[42] The applicant submits that the decision in Ingram is distinguishable from this case 
because in that case, the applicant included a claim for damages for infliction of mental 
harm and moral damages, which the Tribunal found to be essentially the same as the 
compensation she sought in the Application.  
[43] She submi ts that Mauch is distinguishable because the applicant in that case 
explicitly mentioned the Code and claimed discrimination in her initial filing, but then 
amended the claim to remove them.   
[44] She submits that she did not amend her claim in an effort to av oid the application 
of s. 34(11),  but rather to avail herself of the opportunity to proceed to summary judgment.  
Her submissions state “By amending her Claim to remove any reference to the nature 
and extent of her disability, and the impact her disability  would have on her ability to find 
similar employment, Ms. Yang narrowed the scope of her civil claim for reasonable notice, 
she did not withdraw any claim for Code -based damages”.   
2021 HRTO 246 (CanLII)  
 13 ANALYSIS AND DECISION  
[45] Section 34(11) of the Code reads as follows:  
A person who believes that one of his or her rights under Part I has been 
infringed may not make an application under subsection (1) with respect to 
that right if,  
(a)   a civil proceeding has been commenced in a cou rt in which the person 
is seekin g an order  under section 46.1 with respect to the alleged 
infringement and the proceeding has not been finally determined or 
withdrawn; or  
(b)   a court has finally determined the issue of whether the right has been 
infringed or the matter has been settled.  
[46] Section  46.1 reads as follows : 
46.1 (1) If, in a civil proceeding in a court, the court finds that a party to the 
proceeding has infringed a right under Part L of another party to the 
proceeding, the court may make either of the following orders, or both:  
1.   An order directing the party who infringed the right to pay monetary 
compensation to the party whose right was infringed for loss arising out of 
the infringement, including compensation for injury to dignity, feelings and 
self-respect.  
2.   An order directin g the party who infringed the right to make restitution to 
the party whose right was infringed, other than through monetary 
compensation, for loss arising out of the infringement, including restitution 
for injury to dignity, feelings and self -respect.  
(2) Subsection (1) does not permit a person to commence an action based 
solely on an infringement of a right under Part l.

(2) Subsection (1) does not permit a person to commence an action based 
solely on an infringement of a right under Part l.  
[47]   In Linton v. Regional Municipality of Peel Police Services Board , 2009 HRTO 
1449 , at paragrap h 6, the Tribunal described the operation of s. 34(11) as follows:  
If a person raises in a civil proceeding an allegation of an infringement of a 
right under the Code arising out of a specific factual context, s. 34(11) bars 
that person from also filing an application before the Tribunal to claim a 
Code infringement arising out of the same factual context.    
2021 HRTO 246 (CanLII)  
 14 [48] The Tribunal has stated that it is not necessary for an applicant to cite the Code  or 
section 46.1 in his or her civil proceedings to find an Application barred pursuant to s. 
34(11) of the Code . 
[49] In Beaver  at paragraph 10 , the Tribunal discussed the purpose of s. 34(11):  
Section 34(11) is intended to eliminate duplicate court and Tribunal 
proceedings alleging breaches of the Code. An applicant’s ability to bring 
an application at the Tribunal  is removed where there is an ongoing court 
proceeding in which he or she has made a claim for remedies based upon 
the same alleged infringement of the Code, where a court has finally 
determined the issue of whether the right has been violated, or where th e 
matter has been settled. Section 34(11) is triggered by the applicant’s 
decision to raise the Code and seek remedies for its violation in a court 
action.  
[50] The applicant cites Rinaldi in which the Tribunal stated  at para. 12 : 
There is no doubt that a person is entitled to bring a civil action and also 
proceed with a human rights application in certain circumstances . The most 
common example of this occurs when a person’s employment is terminated.  
The person can bring a civil ac tion for wrongful dismissal seeking 
reasonable notice damages, and can also proceed with a human rights 
application alleging that discrimination was a factor in the termination of 
employment. These two proceedings raise different factual and legal 
issues, and provide different potential remedies.  
[51] However, i n that decision, the Tribunal went on to state  in para. 13 : 
What a person cannot do is to take one event or transaction, such as the 
applicant’s allegations regarding the events of April 27, 2016, and hiv e off 
some aspects of that event or transaction as the basis of one proceeding, 
such as a civil claim, and leave other aspects of this very same transaction 
to form the basis for a human rights application. It is this kind of case -
splitting that offends th e principles of judicial economy and the integrity of 
the administration of justice.      
[52]  The applicant’s civil action very clearly arises out of the same facts as the 
Application and, I find that  in essence, the applicant seeks remedies for the same alle ged 
violations of the Code  in the civil action as in the Application.  Paragraphs 4 through 14 of 
her Statement of Claim, above, recount ess entially the same allegations she makes in 
2021 HRTO 246 (CanLII)  
 15 her Application to the Tribunal. While she states that she has not sought damages alleging 
a breach of the Code, running  through paragraphs 4 through 14 is  a claim that she was 
discriminated against and reprised against on the basis of her disability and on the basis 
of having sought accommodation for her disability. In her expl anation for the fact that she 
was seeking 12 months; pay in lieu of notice, she again harkens back to her disability.

[53] While it may be permissible for an individual to file a Statement of Claim for

here the overlay of allegations is so striking as to make any differentiation between the 
two claims, meaningless. The basis of the applicant’s resulting claim for damages in her 
Statement of Claim is that the respondent dismissed her for no good reason, as it 
discriminated against her. As the Tribunal stated in Mauch , merely amending a Statement 
of Claim cannot remove the bar imposed by s. 34(11) of the Code. In any event, I note 
that the applicant did not remove paragrap hs 11 or 12  of her Statement of Claim , in which 
she recounts that she “could not return to work because her cane was not permitted in 
the plants ” and then states that her employment was “terminated without cause”.  
[54] In the October 3, 2018 Direction from the  judge,  he states that in removing certain 
paragraphs from the statement of claim, she “ seeks to  reduce this action  solely to the 
issue of damages for lack of sufficient notice of termination .” (emphasis added).   He stated 
that she would “ pursue her claim for damages relating to allegedly oppressive behaviour 
by Maple Leaf Foods before the Human Rights Tribunal” , and characterized the Amended 
Statement of Claim as “stripped down’. It is evident that the judge concluded that prior to 
the Amendments which reduced the action to solely the issue of damages for lack of 
notice, the applicant was placing allegations of discrimination before the Court for its 
determination. I find that in filing her Statement of Claim, the applicant was seeking from 
the Court, in ac cordance with section 46.1(1), “ An order directing the party who infringed 
the right to pay monetary compensation to the party whose right was infringed for loss 
arising out of the infringement ”.

 16 [55] This Application  falls within the circumstances described in  section 34(11). 
Consequently, the Application may not proceed because the language in section 34(11) 
is a mandatory bar and the Tribunal has no jurisdiction over this Application.  
[56]  Given my finding regarding the applicability of section 34(11), it is not necessary 
for me to address the parties’ arguments regarding section 45.1 of the Code, the MOS or 
Abuse of Process.  
DIRECTIONS  
[57] The Application is dismissed . 
Dated at Toronto, this 31st day of March , 2021.
