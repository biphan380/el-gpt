 3 INTRODUCTION  
[1] This Application alleges discrimination with respect to  employment  because of 
race, colour, ancestry, place of origin, ethnic origin, family status, marital status and age 
contrary to the Human Rights Code , R.S.O. 1990, c. H.19, as amended (the “ Code ”). 
Although all of the grounds enumerated above were identified in the original Application, 
at the hearing , the applicant, through counsel, focussed on race, colour, ethnic origin 
and age.   
[2] Specifically, t he applicant  asserts that she was not offered, or given the 
opportunity to compete for, a position that was given to a person who was  one of her 
direct reports , for reasons relating to the Code grounds identified. She asserts that she 
was, instead , left in the part of the company’s business that was being phased out.   
[3] The applicant  argues that this position was one that would have put her on a path 
to senior management within the r espondent organization and she was denied that 
opportunity because of Code  grounds . It was given, instead, to someone who was less 
experienced because the other candidate was younger and not a member of a 
racialized group . The applicant argues that this is a case of “systemic discrimination”.  
[4] The respondent denies discrimination, asserts that the applicant was a valued 
employee  who rose within the ranks of their organization rapidly and  argues that placing 
the applicant in the job in question would have amounted to a demotion  for the 
applicant , with a commensurate removal of management responsibilities and decreases 
in salary grade, amount and benefits .  
[5] The respondent  points out that the applicant did not approach any member of the 
senior management group about the job in question or indicate that she believed she 
had been discriminated against until her exit interview by which time she had already 
voluntarily  resigned her employment . The respondent  seeks dismissal of the 
Application.  
2016 HRTO 107 (CanLII)  
 4 [6] This Application was heard over four days in February and May, 2014.  For the 
reasons that follow, this Application is dismissed.  
THE LAW  
[7] The relevant sections of the Code  are as follows:  
5(1) Every person has a right to equal treatment with respect to 
employment without discrimination because of race, ancestry, place of 
origin, colour, ethnic origin, citizenship, creed, sex, sexual orientation, 
gender identity, gender expression, age, record of  offences, marital status, 
family status or disability.  
(2) Every person who is an employee has a right to freedom from 
harassment in the workplace by the employer or agent of the employer or 
by another employee because of race, ancestry, place of origin,  colour, 
ethnic origin, citizenship, creed, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender 
expression, age, record of offences, marital status, family status or 
disability.

It is housed in same building and share s office space .   
[13] The parties agree that the applicant was a good employee , received excellent 
performance reviews and rose within the ranks very quickly.    
[14] The applicant began working for the respondent company on April 5, 2010. At the 
time she was hired, she worked in a non -management role at a salary of $44,500.00. 
She was considered to be part of salary grade 7. She received a performance bonus of 
3.5% that year.  
2016 HRTO 107 (CanLII)  
 6 [15] One year later, she was promoted to the manager level. Her salary increased by 
more than $10.000.00 to $57,500.0 0, and she went from salary grade 7 to 10. In 
January, 2012, she received another $1,000.00 raise.  
[16] As of June, 2012, she was manager of group administration and had seen a 
$23,000.00 increase in her salary and had moved up 5 grids on the salary scale in a 
two-year period. By that time, she was at salary grade 12  and earning $67,500.00 . 
[17] The parties spent some time during the hearing providing me with evidence 
about the racial composition of the workplace.  The applicant asserts that the executive 
management group is made up exclusively of non -racialized persons, while the 
composition of the administrative and clerical staff is more diverse and includes some 
racialized members.   
[18] The respondent indicates that the applicant was part of the management team 
and, as a result, there were racialized persons within the management structure of the 
company.  It also argues that the executive management group is diverse in ways not 
having to do with race but in respect of gender and sexual orientation. The respondent 
agreed that the staff is diverse and includes racialized persons.   
[19] At the time the applicant worked at the respondent company, it had two main 
lines of business ; public and private. The public side managed dental benefits for some 
public organizations such a s children’s aid societies and social assistance recipients . To 
use the language of the industry, it amounted to approximately 300,000 “lives” and 
constituted about 80% of the company’s business.  
[20] The other side of the business , the private side, involved a cting a s a third -party 
administrator for employers who funded their own benefits plans  health (vision, hospital, 
medical equipment, prescription) and dental. The company would create booklets, 
provide cards to employees, receive and pay claims. They would charge an 
admin istrative  fee for this service  and the client  would be billed monthly or quarterly.  
The private side represented 20% of the respondent’s business .   
2016 HRTO 107 (CanLII)  
 7 [21] The applicant worked on the private side of the business. She testified that w hen 
she came on board, the private side was in a state of disarray. There had been a 
number of team lead s, customers had expressed dissatisfaction , and there had been 
instances of overpayments  or claims not being paid properly.   
[22] The p rivate side of the bu siness was not growing. Some groups were cancelling  
contracts  and the few coming on were smaller. The applicant testified that d uring a 
meeting with staff in the summer of 2012, Doug Cooper , the respondent’s CEO,  had 
indicated that the respondent would not be investing in the private side and would, 
instead, be focussing on the public side of the business.  
[23] The applicant testified that, as a result, she was looking for opportunities to work 
on the public side of th e business and learn more about it. She was interested in 
eventually moving into the senior or executive management group and knew that in 
order to do so, she would need to be come an integral  part of the public side of the 
company’s business.  Although she had made her interest in moving to the public side of 
the business  known , she had not been  given any opportunities to do so.

The applicant testified that d uring a 
meeting with staff in the summer of 2012, Doug Cooper , the respondent’s CEO,  had 
indicated that the respondent would not be investing in the private side and would, 
instead, be focussing on the public side of the business.  
[23] The applicant testified that, as a result, she was looking for opportunities to work 
on the public side of th e business and learn more about it. She was interested in 
eventually moving into the senior or executive management group and knew that in 
order to do so, she would need to be come an integral  part of the public side of the 
company’s business.  Although she had made her interest in moving to the public side of 
the business  known , she had not been  given any opportunities to do so.   
[24] The applicant was caught by surprise  when , on December 6, 2012, she was told 
by the CEO, Doug Cooper, and Sandy Fick , a member of  the executive management 
team , that  “CQ” , a member of the team that reported to her , was being moved to  a 
newly created position  on the public side of the business . In her new role, CQ would be 
reporting directly to Sandy Fick.   
[25] The job had not been posted, an open competition had not been held and, in the 
applicant’ s opinion , there were several more qualified and experienced candidates for 
the job that could have been selected.  
[26] Although her team had been reduced by the departure of CQ, the applicant was 
told that the  position would not be refilled and the  workload would have to be 
redistributed between the remaining staff on the team .   
2016 HRTO 107 (CanLII)  
 8 [27] The applicant believed that this signalled that CQ was being groomed for a 
position in the senior or executive managemen t group, something to which she aspired.  
She believed that she was being left in a part of the business that was dying out.  
[28] She did not raise her discrimination concerns during the meeting on December 6, 
2012. However, she did object to the fact that her t eam would now have to continue to 
operate with fewer resources . She  later sent an email seeking  additional pay for the 
team as a result of the higher workload; a request that was denied.  
[29] I heard a great deal of evidence about the applicant’s view that the process by 
which this job was created and filled was irregular and that while she considered CQ a 
good employee  and had provided her with positive performance reviews , she did not 
find her to be  an exceptional one . She also te stified that CQ’s qualifications and 
experience  were not so stellar that she was an obvious fit for the job. The applicant’s 
view was that o ther older and racialized employees had been overlooked by the 
respondent when filling the job without a competition , including  the applicant.   
[30] The applicant filed the instant Application to the Tribunal on December 10, 2012 , 
and resigned her employment on December 20, 2012 , as she felt she could not 
continue in her job with the respondent . The parties agree that d uring  her exit interview 
with Doug Cooper on January 4, 2013, the applicant  raised the issue of discrimination  
with the respondent for the first time . 
[31] The applicant says that during that meeting, when she raised the issue of 
discrimination and the improper transfer of CQ, she was told that the position was given 
to CQ because she was a good fit and had skill s, such as marketing,  that the applicant 
did not.   
[32] Doug Cooper’s version of what took place during that meeting differs. H e gave 
evidence that  when the appl icant resigned, he had assumed initially that she had found 
another job, perhaps with a competitor, and he was sorry to see her go. He says he 
knew that the applicant was upset that CQ had been transferred out of her department

3. What were the circumstances surrounding the applicant's resignation, and what issues did she raise during her exit interview with CEO Doug Cooper?

Higher-level summaries:
- The applicant was interested in moving to the public side of the business after the CEO announced a shift in focus. However, she was not given any opportunities to do so.
- The applicant was surprised when a team member was moved to a new position on the public side without an open competition. She believed there were more qualified candidates and felt that older and racialized employees were overlooked.
- The applicant resigned her position and raised the issue of discrimination during her exit interview. The CEO's account of the meeting differed from the applicant's.

 9 because of her reaction duri ng the meeting of December 6, 2012, but that he was

[33] Doug Cooper says that the respondent valued the applicant’s contribution  and 
that she had been instrumental in sorting out issues in her department and then 
ensuring the continued smooth operation of the private side of the business.  
[34] He indicated that although the respondent was engaged in restructuring  
activities , any plans to divest itself of the private side of the business did not inclu de an 
intention to let the applicant go. He confirmed that the company’s plans for the applicant  
involved having her eventually move into the role of manager of operations but 
acknowledged that had not yet been communicated to her.    
[35] Doug Cooper  says that during his meetings with the applicant he had tried to 
explain to her that th e reason the position was created was that in November, 2012, a 
new software system had been purchased and Sandy Fick’s responsibilities were 
increasing as a result of this purcha se.  Sandy Fick  needed additional administrative 
assistance.  The job CQ was put into, according to him, was  an administrative role , with 
no management duties or responsibilities and compensated at a much lower level – 
salary grade 9.  He said that the execu tive management team had never considered 
demoting the applicant to take on that role.  
DECISION  
[36] This Application alleges an infringement of section 5 of the Code , which provides 
that every person has the right to equal treatment  with respect to employment without 
discrimination on the basis of race, ancestry, place of origin, colour, ethnic origin, 
citizenship, creed, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, age, 
record of offences, marital status, family status or disability.  
[37] The appli cant has the onus of proving on a balance of probabilities that an 
infringement of the Code  has occurred.   A balance of probabilities means that it is more 
likely than not an infringement has occurred.  
2016 HRTO 107 (CanLII)  
 10 [38] Discrimination is not defined in the Code , but has been the subject of much 
judicial consideration. In Andrew s v. Law  Society of British Columbia , [1989] 1 S.C.R. 
143, in discussing the meaning of discrimination under the Charter of Rights and 
Freedoms,  the Supreme Court of Canada stated:  
…discri mination may be described as a distinction, whether intentional or 
not but based on grounds relating to the personal characteristics of the 
individual or group which has the effect of imposing burdens, obligations, 
or disadvantages on such individual or gr oup not imposed on others, or 
which withholds or limits access to opportunities, benefits, and advantages 
available to other members of society. Distinctions based on personal 
characteristics attributed to an individual solely on the basis of association 
with a group will rarely escape the charge of discrimination, while those 
based on an individual’s merits and capacities will rarely be so classified.  
[39] Subsequent decisions of the Supreme Court of Canada have gone on to say 
that discrimination under both th e Code  and the Charter  require the applicant to 
establish a distinction on a prohibited ground to a member of a protected group that 
creates a disadvantage by perpetuating disadvantage or prejudice, or by stereotyping.  
See: Law  v. Canada (Minister of Empl oyment and Immigration) , [1999] 1 S.C.R. 497, R. 
v. Kapp , 2008 SCC 41, and Withler v. Canada (Attorney General) , 2011 SCC 12.

Higher-level summaries:
- Doug Cooper, presumably a representative of AccertaClaim Servicorp Inc., provides his account of the applicant's resignation and subsequent allegations of discrimination. He expresses surprise at the allegations, praises the applicant's contributions, and outlines the company's plans for her future role. He also explains the creation of a new position due to the purchase of a new software system.
- The document also discusses the legal framework for discrimination under the Code and the Charter, citing several Supreme Court of Canada decisions. It explains the burden of proof required for proving discrimination and the definition of discrimination.

[39] Subsequent decisions of the Supreme Court of Canada have gone on to say 
that discrimination under both th e Code  and the Charter  require the applicant to 
establish a distinction on a prohibited ground to a member of a protected group that 
creates a disadvantage by perpetuating disadvantage or prejudice, or by stereotyping.  
See: Law  v. Canada (Minister of Empl oyment and Immigration) , [1999] 1 S.C.R. 497, R. 
v. Kapp , 2008 SCC 41, and Withler v. Canada (Attorney General) , 2011 SCC 12.  
[40] In order to establish that her right to equal treatment in respect of employment 
has been infringed by the respondent, the applicant must es tablish that she has been 
subjected to differential and disadvantageous treatment on the basis of a Code  ground 
or that a neutral rule or requirement has had a differential impact on her resulting in 
disadvantage as a result of her members hip in a group identified by a Code  ground.  
[41] The applicant argues that this is not a case of direct discrimination. Instead, she 
argues that this is a case of “systemic discrimination”  and has argued that the principles 
in the Supreme Court of Canada’s decision in Ontario Human Rights Commission v. 
Simpson s-Sears , [1985] 2 S.C.R. 536, apply . 
[42] She says that the respondent company’s senior or executive management group 
is exclusively Cauca sian and there are no racialized persons within that group. She also 
2016 HRTO 107 (CanLII)  
 11 asserts that j obs involving administrative and support functions in the company were 
filled by r acialized  persons , such as the applicant.   
[43] She argues that the decision to create a positio n and fill it without competition 
with a younger white woman is evidence that the respondent seeks to perpetuate that 
state of inequality and that decision resulted in a disadvantage to her  on the basis of 
Code grounds . 
[44] The respondent disagrees and argues that the applicant was, herself, a member 
of the management team of the respondent business before she resigned and it is 
inaccurate, therefore, to suggest that the management team is exclusively Caucasian 
and non -racialized. It says that there is diversit y both within the broader company as 
well the executive management team.  
[45] The respondent also argues that its decision to create and fill a new position 
without an open competition within the workplace was not in contravention of its own 
policies as it is o pen to the company to promote staff without a competition  and points 
out that one of the applicant’s own promotions did not involve a competition .  
[46] In any event, the respondent argues that the position in question was an 
administrative one and not a stepping stone to a seat a t the executive management 
table, as the applicant has assumed . It argues that the position created was not a 
management position and placing the applicant in that position would have amounted to 
demoting her  because of the lower salary grade, lower compensation level, lesser 
vacation entitlement and removal of management  tasks and responsibilities . 
[47] I am not persuaded of the relevance of the current racial composition  of the 
executive management group within the responde nt company to the issue s at hand. 
Assuming , without finding , that the executive management team was made up of 
exclusively non -racialized persons, that finding would not, in and of itself, lead me to 
conclude that the rights of the individual applicant in this Applic ation were infringed as a 
result of the racial composition of the various job categories within the company.  
2016 HRTO 107 (CanLII)  
 12 [48] The event that brought matters to a head for the applicant was the creation of a 
job and the appointment of CQ to that job by the executive managem ent group.

conclude that the rights of the individual applicant in this Applic ation were infringed as a 
result of the racial composition of the various job categories within the company.  
2016 HRTO 107 (CanLII)  
 12 [48] The event that brought matters to a head for the applicant was the creation of a 
job and the appointment of CQ to that job by the executive managem ent group.  
[49] Indeed, before that event, it is undisputed that the applicant , a racialized person,  
had experienced a steady and rapid progression through the ranks of the respondent 
company, had not raised any issues regarding being overlooked for promotion and 
advancement , and had not identified any barriers being placed in her path  or 
opportunities to which she or other racialized employees had been denied access.   
[50] Again, assuming , without finding , that the new position was improperly filled, 
without posting it and holding an open competition, it is not disputed that the p osition 
was one that  was at salary grade 9 and compensated at a level lower than the 
applicant’s salary in Dece mber, 2012.    
[51] If the job was improperly filled and I was to accept that there was, as the 
applicant argues, a “preferential hiring” or promotion of CQ, it resulted in CQ filling a 
position that would have amounted to a demotion for the applicant.  
[52] In other words, if there w as a preferential hiring or promotion of CQ, and 
differential treatment or a differential impact based in part on Code  grounds  occurred , 
those disad vantaged by these events  would have been co -workers working in positions 
alongside CQ, not the applicant, who was her manager.  It would be those individuals 
who could suggest that they had a legitimate grievance about the events in question.  
[53] I am not persuaded by the applicant’s evidence or argument that there was any 
discernable disadvantage arising out of the hiring or promotion of CQ to the applicant. 
Any future possible disadvantage to the applicant or advantage to CQ from the latter 
being placed in t his job , envisioned by the applicant , is speculative  and remote.  
[54] The mere fact that another person in the respondent company is promoted into 
another position does not lead inevitably to the conclusion that the applicant is being 
2016 HRTO 107 (CanLII)  
 13 disadvantaged or harmed as a result , particularly if, as is the case here, the transfer 
would amount to a demotion .   
[55] Even if the applicant is correct in assuming that CQ was being groomed to move 
up in the company, it does not follow that the applicant was disadvantaged or that her 
history of advancement and promotion was going to be negatively  impacted  going 
forward , i.e. that she would no longer being considered or “groomed” for advancement 
in the respondent company .  That is a conclusion, based on an assumption made by the 
applicant, that I do not find supported by the evidence that I have he ard. 
[56] Finally, even if I were to accept that the applicant was disadvantaged by not 
being given an opportunity to compete for the position CQ was placed into, I find that 
the respondent has provided me with a non -discriminatory explanation , unconnected to 
any Code  grounds,  for its failure to consider the applicant for that job, specifically that it 
would have amounted to a demotion to consider or place her in the job and the 
respondent did not wish to demote the applicant.  
[57] As a result, I find that t he applic ant has not established  on a balance of 
probabilities that her right  to equal treatment in respect of employment under the Code  
has been infringed.  
[58] Accordingly, t he Application is dismissed.
