 3 INTRODUCTION 
[1] On April 19, 2018, the applicant filed an Application alleging the respondent 
discriminated against him with respect to employment on the basis of family status 
contrary to the Human Rights Code, R.S.O. 1990 c. H. 19, as amended (the “Code”).  
[2]  By Case Assessment Direction (“CAD”) dated March 8, 2023, the Tribunal 
directed that a summary hearing be held to address whether the Application should be 
dismissed on the basis that there is no reasonable prospect that it will succeed pursuant 
to Rule 19A of the Tribunal’s Rules of Procedure.  
[3] As explained more fully below, I find that the Application must be dismissed on the 
basis that it has no reasonable prospect of success under the Code. Even if I accept all 
the facts alleged by the applicant as true, the applicant has not been able to point to any 
evidence beyond his own suspicions that the respondent was treating him differently 
based on Code grounds. 
SUMMARY HEARING PROCESS 
[4] The summary hearing process is described in Rule 19A of the Tribunal’s Rules of 
Procedure (‘Rules”) as well as the Tribunal’s Practice Direction on Summary Hearing
Requests. The purpose of a summary hearing is to consider whether an Application 
should be dismissed in whole or in part because there is no reasonable prospect that the 
Application will succeed. 
[5]  The Tribunal cannot address allegations of unfairness that are unrelated to the 
Code. The Tribunal’s jurisdiction is limited to claims of discrimination that are linked to the 
protections set out in the Code. 
[6] The test that is applied at the summary hearing stage is whether an Application 
has no reasonable prospect of success. At this stage, the Tribunal is not determining 
whether the applicant is telling the truth or assessing the impact of the treatment he 
experienced. The test of no reasonable prospect of success is determined by assuming 2023 HRTO 1081 (CanLII)  
 4 the applicant’s version of events is true unless there is some clear evidenceto the 
contrary or the evidence is not disputed by the applicant. 
[7] However, and significantly, accepting the facts alleged by the applicant does not 
include accepting the applicant’s assumptions about why he was treated unfairly. The 
purpose of the summary hearing is to determine whether the applicant can point to any 
information which tends to support his belief that he has experienced discrimination under 
the Code.

 3 INTRODUCTION  
[1] This Application alleges discrimination with respect to employment because of 
disability, family status and reprisal contrary to the Human Rights Code , R.S.O. 1990, c. 
H.19, as amended (the “ Code ”). 
[2] The applicant alleges that the respondent  failed to comply  with its duty to 
accommodate the applicant’s disabilit y subsequent to  a motor vehicle accident which 
occurred on November 27, 2017  and further that the respondent discriminated against 
the applicant on the basis of disability, family status and reprisal  in relation to the 
termination of the applicant’s employment on January 19, 2018.  
[3] The respondent denies any discrimination in violation of the Code . 
[4] For the reasons provided below and based on the evidence presented at the merit s 
hearing and the written s ubmissions of the parties, I conclude that the applicant has not 
proven, on a balance of probabilities, that the respondent’s conduct amounts to 
discrimination in violation of the Code.  Accordingly,  the Application is dismissed.  
PROCEDURAL BACKGROUN D 
[5] In the Application , the applicant initially sought, among other things, a declaration 
that the applicant’s employment with the respondent was wrongfully terminated, together 
with damages for wrongful dismissal.   
[6] At noted in the Case Assessment Direction dated September 8, 2022, i n the face 
of the respondent’s  Form 10  Request for an Order During Proceeding s for a dismissal of 
all claims based on the wrongful dismissal allegations , the applicant agreed to withdraw 
those claims.  Accordingly,  and in accordance with the jurisdiction of this Tribunal, this 
Application proceeded solely with regards to any breach of the Code  on the grounds of 
disability, family status and reprisal in the social area of employme nt.  
[7] A merit s hearing in this matter was held on December 15, 2022.  
2023 HRTO 376 (CanLII)  
 4 [8] The applicant called two witnesses, namely  himself and Rachel Joanne Persad -
Moham med, his spouse.   
[9] The respondent called five witnesses, namely : Heino Cla essens, former CEO  
(“Claessens ”): JF Bosse, former National Sales Manager and current General Manager : 
Suzanne McGrattan, Controller  (“McGrattan ”); Richard Carbis, Service Manager ; and 
Sharon Pateman, Order Desk Manager .  
[10] An Agreed Statement of Facts and Joint Book of Documents  were filed by the 
parties. Multiple  exhibits were filed by the parties, all on consent.

title: Hunter
questions_this_excerpt_can_answer: 1. What evidence did the applicant fail to provide during the summary hearing that could establish a connection between the respondent's actions and the applicant's Code ground?
2. Why did the Tribunal dismiss the application and conclude that the allegations had no reasonable prospect of success?
3. How does the applicant's belief, no matter how strongly held, differ from actual evidence in determining whether discrimination has occurred in this case?
Excerpt:
-----
[15]  The applicant’s position is essentially that the respondent’s conductevinced an 
intention to use constructive dismissal as a way to get him to accept the scheduling 
changes or leave their employment which occurred on March 29, 2018. 
FINDINGS   
[16] The applicant clearly disagrees with the treatment by the respondent involving the 
allegations about the level of support given and the loss of his employment by constructive 
dismissal. However, the applicant has not pointed to any evidence of any link between 
the respondent and the alleged unfair treatment and a Code ground. 
[17] The applicant believes he had been unfairly treated and for the applicant this was 
an issue. However, there is no evidence the applicant has or can point to that the 
applicant’sCode ground was a factor in the actions of the respondent. 
[18] Despite being given the opportunity during the summary hearing to inform the 
Tribunal of evidence in his possession or that may be reasonably available at the merits 
hearing, the applicant could not point to any evidence to make the connection between 2023 HRTO 1081 (CanLII)  
 6 the alleged lack of support and the loss of employment with the respondent and hisCode-
enumerated ground. 
[19] The Tribunal” does not have jurisdiction over general allegations of unfairness 
unrelated to the Code”: Hay v. Ontario (Human Rights Tribunal), 2014 ONSC 2858: Bello 
v. Toronto Transit Commission, 2014 ONSC 5535. To fall within the Tribunal’s jurisdiction, 
“an Application must provide some factual basis beyond a bald assertion which link’s their
ground(s) to the respondent’s actions and explains why they think that these actions are 
discriminatory in nature “: Hay, at para. 8. 
[20] In Mehedi v. Mondalez Bakery,2023 ONSC 1737, the Divisional Court decided the 
Tribunal’s decision to dismiss the Application was reasonable and citedHay and Xia v. 
Board of Governors of Lakehead University, 2020 ONSC 6150 (Div. Ct.), which upheld 
the Tribunal’s dismissal of anApplication for lack of jurisdiction on the basis that the 
applicant failed to establisha basis “beyond mere speculation and accusations” that the
respondent’s conduct was discriminatorily linked to an enumerated ground. 
[21] As noted above, for an Application to advance to a full hearing on the merits, an 
applicant must be able to point to some evidence beyond his own suspicions, that could 
make out a link to theCode. The Tribunal has repeatedly said that an applicant’sbelief, 
no matter how strongly held, is not evidence upon which the Tribunal might find that 
discrimination has occurred. See for example Leong v. Ontario (Attorney General), 2014 
HRTO 311.  
[22] The applicant has not pointed to any evidence that he has or has reasonably 
available to him that could establish a connection between the respondent’s actions and 
his Code ground.  These allegations have no reasonable prospect of success. 2023 HRTO 1081 (CanLII)  
 7 
ORDER 
[23] For the above reasons, the Application is dismissed. 
Dated at Toronto this 21st day of July, 2023.

 3 INTRODUCTION  
[1] This Application alleges discrimination with respect to  employment  because of 
race, colour, ancestry, place of origin, ethnic origin, family status, marital status and age 
contrary to the Human Rights Code , R.S.O. 1990, c. H.19, as amended (the “ Code ”). 
Although all of the grounds enumerated above were identified in the original Application, 
at the hearing , the applicant, through counsel, focussed on race, colour, ethnic origin 
and age.   
[2] Specifically, t he applicant  asserts that she was not offered, or given the 
opportunity to compete for, a position that was given to a person who was  one of her 
direct reports , for reasons relating to the Code grounds identified. She asserts that she 
was, instead , left in the part of the company’s business that was being phased out.   
[3] The applicant  argues that this position was one that would have put her on a path 
to senior management within the r espondent organization and she was denied that 
opportunity because of Code  grounds . It was given, instead, to someone who was less 
experienced because the other candidate was younger and not a member of a 
racialized group . The applicant argues that this is a case of “systemic discrimination”.  
[4] The respondent denies discrimination, asserts that the applicant was a valued 
employee  who rose within the ranks of their organization rapidly and  argues that placing 
the applicant in the job in question would have amounted to a demotion  for the 
applicant , with a commensurate removal of management responsibilities and decreases 
in salary grade, amount and benefits .  
[5] The respondent  points out that the applicant did not approach any member of the 
senior management group about the job in question or indicate that she believed she 
had been discriminated against until her exit interview by which time she had already 
voluntarily  resigned her employment . The respondent  seeks dismissal of the 
Application.  
2016 HRTO 107 (CanLII)  
 4 [6] This Application was heard over four days in February and May, 2014.  For the 
reasons that follow, this Application is dismissed.  
THE LAW  
[7] The relevant sections of the Code  are as follows:  
5(1) Every person has a right to equal treatment with respect to 
employment without discrimination because of race, ancestry, place of 
origin, colour, ethnic origin, citizenship, creed, sex, sexual orientation, 
gender identity, gender expression, age, record of  offences, marital status, 
family status or disability.  
(2) Every person who is an employee has a right to freedom from 
harassment in the workplace by the employer or agent of the employer or 
by another employee because of race, ancestry, place of origin,  colour, 
ethnic origin, citizenship, creed, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender 
expression, age, record of offences, marital status, family status or 
disability.

)2009 HRTO 877 (CanLII) INTRODUCTION 
[1] This is the Decision with respect to an Application filed under s. 53(3) of the 
Human Rights Code, R.S.O. 1990, c.H-19, as amended (the “Code”).  The complaint 
which underlies the current Application was filed with the Ontario Human Rights 
Commission on July 11, 2005 and abandoned upon the filing of the present Application 
with the Tribunal on November 13, 2008. 
[2] A Case Resolution Conference (“CRC”) was held on June 4, 2009 in accordance 
with the expectation, expressed in theCodeand the Tribunal’s Rules, that section 53(3)
applications proceed in a highly expeditious manner.  I heard from the applicant, the 
respondent Michael Shaw, and the respondents’ witnesses Diane Noto, Bruce Finlay 
and Hanna Katz (by telephone). 
[3] The applicant, who self-identifies as African Canadian, alleges that the
respondent Michael Shaw, a police constable, discriminated against him on the basis of 
race and colour when he stopped and questioned the applicant on March 9, 2005.  The 
other named respondents are the Toronto Police Services Board (“TPSB”) and William 
Blair, Chief of Police. 
[4] I find that Michael Shaw did discriminate against the applicant on March 9, 2005 
in the provision of police services on the basis of colour, contrary to section 1 and 9 of 
the Code.  
[5] The parties agreed to bifurcate this proceeding. The issue of remedy and the
liability of the TPSB and William Blair will be heard on the next day of hearing. 
Chronology of Events 
[6] The following events are not in dispute, except where I specifically note, by using 
words such as alleged, or asserted, or otherwise indicate a contested point. 
[7] On March 9, 2005, the applicant in his capacity of a relief letter carrier employed by 2009 HRTO 877 (CanLII) 2 Canada Post was delivering mail in the area of the Bridle Path, which is a well known
affluent neighbourhood in Toronto.  It was his second day delivering mail on that route. 
He was wearing the Canada Post coat, carrying a mail satchel, and delivering regular 
mail and flyers.  He did not stop at every house as there was no mail for some houses 
and other houses had a “no flyer” notation.   
[8] That day, Michael Shaw, a police constable who had served in the area for 
several years was training a new police constable, Diane Noto.  At the start of their shift 
they were given a Directed Patrol Assignment, recommending that they patrol the area 
where the applicant was delivering mail between 12 p.m. and 4.00 p.m.  The 
assignment details were that phone lines had been cut in the area by suspects 
described as Male, White and East European, who were using a vehicle.     
[9] Constable Shaw decided to patrol the identified area that morning, in accordance 
with the Directed Patrol Assignment.
