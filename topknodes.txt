)2009 HRTO 877 (CanLII) INTRODUCTION 
[1] This is the Decision with respect to an Application filed under s. 53(3) of the 
Human Rights Code, R.S.O. 1990, c.H-19, as amended (the “Code”).  The complaint 
which underlies the current Application was filed with the Ontario Human Rights 
Commission on July 11, 2005 and abandoned upon the filing of the present Application 
with the Tribunal on November 13, 2008. 
[2] A Case Resolution Conference (“CRC”) was held on June 4, 2009 in accordance 
with the expectation, expressed in theCodeand the Tribunal’s Rules, that section 53(3)
applications proceed in a highly expeditious manner.  I heard from the applicant, the 
respondent Michael Shaw, and the respondents’ witnesses Diane Noto, Bruce Finlay 
and Hanna Katz (by telephone). 
[3] The applicant, who self-identifies as African Canadian, alleges that the
respondent Michael Shaw, a police constable, discriminated against him on the basis of 
race and colour when he stopped and questioned the applicant on March 9, 2005.  The 
other named respondents are the Toronto Police Services Board (“TPSB”) and William 
Blair, Chief of Police. 
[4] I find that Michael Shaw did discriminate against the applicant on March 9, 2005 
in the provision of police services on the basis of colour, contrary to section 1 and 9 of 
the Code.  
[5] The parties agreed to bifurcate this proceeding. The issue of remedy and the
liability of the TPSB and William Blair will be heard on the next day of hearing. 
Chronology of Events 
[6] The following events are not in dispute, except where I specifically note, by using 
words such as alleged, or asserted, or otherwise indicate a contested point. 
[7] On March 9, 2005, the applicant in his capacity of a relief letter carrier employed by 2009 HRTO 877 (CanLII) 2 Canada Post was delivering mail in the area of the Bridle Path, which is a well known
affluent neighbourhood in Toronto.  It was his second day delivering mail on that route. 
He was wearing the Canada Post coat, carrying a mail satchel, and delivering regular 
mail and flyers.  He did not stop at every house as there was no mail for some houses 
and other houses had a “no flyer” notation.   
[8] That day, Michael Shaw, a police constable who had served in the area for 
several years was training a new police constable, Diane Noto.  At the start of their shift 
they were given a Directed Patrol Assignment, recommending that they patrol the area 
where the applicant was delivering mail between 12 p.m. and 4.00 p.m.  The 
assignment details were that phone lines had been cut in the area by suspects 
described as Male, White and East European, who were using a vehicle.     
[9] Constable Shaw decided to patrol the identified area that morning, in accordance 
with the Directed Patrol Assignment.
