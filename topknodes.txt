questions_this_excerpt_can_answer: 1. What was the applicant's position in the George v. AccertaClaim Servicorp Inc. case before the Human Rights Tribunal of Ontario?
2. What was the Tribunal's decision in the George v. AccertaClaim Servicorp Inc. case and what were the reasons given for this decision?
3. What precedent cases were cited in the Tribunal's decision in the George v. AccertaClaim Servicorp Inc. case? 

Surrounding context: The context discusses a case before the Human Rights Tribunal of Ontario where the applicant alleges employment discrimination by AccertaClaim Servicorp Inc. The applicant believes he was constructively dismissed as a way to force him to accept scheduling changes or leave his employment. However, the Tribunal found that the applicant failed to provide any evidence linking the alleged unfair treatment to a Code ground, which is necessary for the Tribunal to have jurisdiction over the case. The Tribunal cited several precedent cases to support their decision to dismiss the application.
Excerpt:
-----
[15]  The applicant’s position is essentially that the respondent’s conductevinced an 
intention to use constructive dismissal as a way to get him to accept the scheduling 
changes or leave their employment which occurred on March 29, 2018. 
FINDINGS   
[16] The applicant clearly disagrees with the treatment by the respondent involving the 
allegations about the level of support given and the loss of his employment by constructive 
dismissal. However, the applicant has not pointed to any evidence of any link between 
the respondent and the alleged unfair treatment and a Code ground. 
[17] The applicant believes he had been unfairly treated and for the applicant this was 
an issue. However, there is no evidence the applicant has or can point to that the 
applicant’sCode ground was a factor in the actions of the respondent. 
[18] Despite being given the opportunity during the summary hearing to inform the 
Tribunal of evidence in his possession or that may be reasonably available at the merits 
hearing, the applicant could not point to any evidence to make the connection between 2023 HRTO 1081 (CanLII)  
 6 the alleged lack of support and the loss of employment with the respondent and hisCode-
enumerated ground. 
[19] The Tribunal” does not have jurisdiction over general allegations of unfairness 
unrelated to the Code”: Hay v. Ontario (Human Rights Tribunal), 2014 ONSC 2858: Bello 
v. Toronto Transit Commission, 2014 ONSC 5535. To fall within the Tribunal’s jurisdiction, 
“an Application must provide some factual basis beyond a bald assertion which link’s their
ground(s) to the respondent’s actions and explains why they think that these actions are 
discriminatory in nature “: Hay, at para. 8. 
[20] In Mehedi v. Mondalez Bakery,2023 ONSC 1737, the Divisional Court decided the 
Tribunal’s decision to dismiss the Application was reasonable and citedHay and Xia v. 
Board of Governors of Lakehead University, 2020 ONSC 6150 (Div. Ct.), which upheld 
the Tribunal’s dismissal of anApplication for lack of jurisdiction on the basis that the 
applicant failed to establisha basis “beyond mere speculation and accusations” that the
respondent’s conduct was discriminatorily linked to an enumerated ground. 
[21] As noted above, for an Application to advance to a full hearing on the merits, an 
applicant must be able to point to some evidence beyond his own suspicions, that could 
make out a link to theCode. The Tribunal has repeatedly said that an applicant’sbelief, 
no matter how strongly held, is not evidence upon which the Tribunal might find that 
discrimination has occurred. See for example Leong v. Ontario (Attorney General), 2014 
HRTO 311.  
[22] The applicant has not pointed to any evidence that he has or has reasonably 
available to him that could establish a connection between the respondent’s actions and 
his Code ground.  These allegations have no reasonable prospect of success. 2023 HRTO 1081 (CanLII)  
 7 
ORDER 
[23] For the above reasons, the Application is dismissed. 
Dated at Toronto this 21st day of July, 2023.

  2023 HRTO 1081 (CanLII)  
 3 INTRODUCTION 
[1] On April 19, 2018, the applicant filed an Application alleging the respondent 
discriminated against him with respect to employment on the basis of family status 
contrary to the Human Rights Code, R.S.O. 1990 c. H. 19, as amended (the “Code”).  
[2]  By Case Assessment Direction (“CAD”) dated March 8, 2023, the Tribunal 
directed that a summary hearing be held to address whether the Application should be 
dismissed on the basis that there is no reasonable prospect that it will succeed pursuant 
to Rule 19A of the Tribunal’s Rules of Procedure.  
[3] As explained more fully below, I find that the Application must be dismissed on the 
basis that it has no reasonable prospect of success under the Code. Even if I accept all 
the facts alleged by the applicant as true, the applicant has not been able to point to any 
evidence beyond his own suspicions that the respondent was treating him differently 
based on Code grounds. 
SUMMARY HEARING PROCESS 
[4] The summary hearing process is described in Rule 19A of the Tribunal’s Rules of 
Procedure (‘Rules”) as well as the Tribunal’s Practice Direction on Summary Hearing
Requests. The purpose of a summary hearing is to consider whether an Application 
should be dismissed in whole or in part because there is no reasonable prospect that the 
Application will succeed. 
[5]  The Tribunal cannot address allegations of unfairness that are unrelated to the 
Code. The Tribunal’s jurisdiction is limited to claims of discrimination that are linked to the 
protections set out in the Code. 
[6] The test that is applied at the summary hearing stage is whether an Application 
has no reasonable prospect of success. At this stage, the Tribunal is not determining 
whether the applicant is telling the truth or assessing the impact of the treatment he 
experienced. The test of no reasonable prospect of success is determined by assuming 2023 HRTO 1081 (CanLII)  
 4 the applicant’s version of events is true unless there is some clear evidenceto the 
contrary or the evidence is not disputed by the applicant. 
[7] However, and significantly, accepting the facts alleged by the applicant does not 
include accepting the applicant’s assumptions about why he was treated unfairly. The 
purpose of the summary hearing is to determine whether the applicant can point to any 
information which tends to support his belief that he has experienced discrimination under 
the Code.

questions_this_excerpt_can_answer: 1) What are the principles that apply in cases where an allegation of racial discrimination has been raised according to the Human Rights Tribunal of Ontario?
2) How does the Human Rights Tribunal of Ontario handle cases where there is no direct evidence of racial discrimination?
3) What is the role of circumstantial evidence in cases of alleged racial discrimination according to the Human Rights Tribunal of Ontario?
Excerpt:
-----
[14] The applicant subsequently hailed the police officers to inquire why they had 
stopped him.  A conversation ensued, the contents of which are disputed. 
[15] The applicant believed that the police officers’ decision to stop and question him 
was because of his skin colour and he testified that he was upset, dazed and in shock.  
While continuing on his route that day, he noted that a White male delivering water in 
the area was not questioned.  He stopped at three construction sites where there were 
White workers and asked them if any of them had been stopped by the police.  None of 
them had been.  This is not disputed by the respondents.  The applicant also met up 
with Mr. Finlay that morning and learned that the police had questioned him (Finlay) 
about the letter carriers in the area.
Analysis and Conclusions 
[16] The relevant principles that apply in cases where an allegation of racial 2009 HRTO 877 (CanLII) 4 discrimination has been raised have been usefully summarized as follows:
(a) The prohibited ground or grounds of discrimination need not be the 
sole or the major factor leading to the discriminatory conduct; it is 
sufficient if they are a factor; 
(b) There is no need to establish an intention or motivation to 
discriminate; the focus of the enquiry is on the effect of the respondent's 
actions on the complainant; 
(c) The prohibited ground or grounds need not be the cause of the 
respondent's discriminatory conduct; it is sufficient if they are a factor or 
operative element; 
(d) There need be no direct evidence of discrimination; discrimination 
will more often be proven by circumstantial evidence and inference; and 
(e) Racial stereotyping will usually be the result of subtle unconscious 
beliefs, biases and prejudices. 
Radek v. Henderson Development (Canada) Ltd. (No. 3) (2005), 52 
C.H.R.R. D/430, 2005 BCHRT 302 at para. 482; Pritchard v. Ziedler (2007), 
CHRR Doc. 07-527 (Sask. H.R.T.). 
[17] In this case, as in many cases alleging racial discrimination, there is no direct 
evidence that race was a factor in the officer’s decision to take the actions that he did.  
As a result, the issue of whether the officer’s actions amount to racial discrimination in 
violation of the Codefalls to be determined in accordance with the following well-
established principles applicable to circumstantial evidence cases. 
1) Once a prima facie case of discrimination has been established, the 
burden shifts to the respondent to provide a rational explanation which is 
not discriminatory. 
2) It is not sufficient to rebut an inference of discrimination that the 
respondent is able to suggest just any rational alternative explanation. The 
respondent must offer an explanation which is credible on all the
evidence. 
3) A complainant is not required to establish that the respondent’s
actions lead to no other conclusion but that discrimination was the basis 
for the decision at issue in a given case. 2009 HRTO 877 (CanLII) 5 4) There is no requirement that the respondents' conduct, to be found
discriminatory, must be consistent with the allegation of discrimination and 
inconsistent with any other rational explanation. 
5) The ultimate issue is whether an inference of discrimination is more 
probable from the evidence than the actual explanations offered by the 
respondent. 
[18] In determining whether the inference of racial discrimination is more probable 
than the explanations offered by the respondent officer, I also need to be mindful of the 
nature of racial discrimination as it is understood today and that it will often be the 
product of learned attitudes and biases and often operates on an unconscious level: 
Nassiah v. Peel (Regional Municipality) Services Board,2007 HRTO 14 (CanLII).
[19] Courts in Canada have accepted that racial profiling by police occurs in Canada 
and have indicated their willingness to scrutinize seemingly “neutral” police behaviour to 
assess whether it falls within the phenomenon of racial profiling.  In R. v. Brown (2003) 
64 O.R. (3) 161 (Ont. CA) at para.

questions_this_excerpt_can_answer: 1. What is the applicant's argument regarding the nature of discrimination in her case?
2. How does the respondent company refute the applicant's claims of racial discrimination within its management team?
3. What was the event that escalated the situation for the applicant according to the document? 

Higher-level summaries:
- The document discusses a case of alleged employment discrimination brought before the Human Rights Tribunal of Ontario. The applicant claims systemic discrimination, arguing that the respondent company's management is exclusively Caucasian and that jobs involving administrative and support functions are filled by racialized persons. 
- The respondent company refutes these claims, arguing that the applicant herself was a member of the management team before she resigned. The company also argues that its decision to create and fill a new position without an open competition was not in contravention of its own policies. 
- The situation escalated for the applicant when a job was created and filled by the executive management group without competition.
Excerpt:
-----
Distinctions based on personal 
characteristics attributed to an individual solely on the basis of association 
with a group will rarely escape the charge of discrimination, while those 
based on an individual’s merits and capacities will rarely be so classified.  
[39] Subsequent decisions of the Supreme Court of Canada have gone on to say 
that discrimination under both th e Code  and the Charter  require the applicant to 
establish a distinction on a prohibited ground to a member of a protected group that 
creates a disadvantage by perpetuating disadvantage or prejudice, or by stereotyping.  
See: Law  v. Canada (Minister of Empl oyment and Immigration) , [1999] 1 S.C.R. 497, R. 
v. Kapp , 2008 SCC 41, and Withler v. Canada (Attorney General) , 2011 SCC 12.  
[40] In order to establish that her right to equal treatment in respect of employment 
has been infringed by the respondent, the applicant must es tablish that she has been 
subjected to differential and disadvantageous treatment on the basis of a Code  ground 
or that a neutral rule or requirement has had a differential impact on her resulting in 
disadvantage as a result of her members hip in a group identified by a Code  ground.  
[41] The applicant argues that this is not a case of direct discrimination. Instead, she 
argues that this is a case of “systemic discrimination”  and has argued that the principles 
in the Supreme Court of Canada’s decision in Ontario Human Rights Commission v. 
Simpson s-Sears , [1985] 2 S.C.R. 536, apply . 
[42] She says that the respondent company’s senior or executive management group 
is exclusively Cauca sian and there are no racialized persons within that group. She also 
2016 HRTO 107 (CanLII)  
 11 asserts that j obs involving administrative and support functions in the company were 
filled by r acialized  persons , such as the applicant.   
[43] She argues that the decision to create a positio n and fill it without competition 
with a younger white woman is evidence that the respondent seeks to perpetuate that 
state of inequality and that decision resulted in a disadvantage to her  on the basis of 
Code grounds . 
[44] The respondent disagrees and argues that the applicant was, herself, a member 
of the management team of the respondent business before she resigned and it is 
inaccurate, therefore, to suggest that the management team is exclusively Caucasian 
and non -racialized. It says that there is diversit y both within the broader company as 
well the executive management team.  
[45] The respondent also argues that its decision to create and fill a new position 
without an open competition within the workplace was not in contravention of its own 
policies as it is o pen to the company to promote staff without a competition  and points 
out that one of the applicant’s own promotions did not involve a competition .  
[46] In any event, the respondent argues that the position in question was an 
administrative one and not a stepping stone to a seat a t the executive management 
table, as the applicant has assumed . It argues that the position created was not a 
management position and placing the applicant in that position would have amounted to 
demoting her  because of the lower salary grade, lower compensation level, lesser 
vacation entitlement and removal of management  tasks and responsibilities . 
[47] I am not persuaded of the relevance of the current racial composition  of the 
executive management group within the responde nt company to the issue s at hand. 
Assuming , without finding , that the executive management team was made up of 
exclusively non -racialized persons, that finding would not, in and of itself, lead me to 
conclude that the rights of the individual applicant in this Applic ation were infringed as a 
result of the racial composition of the various job categories within the company.  
2016 HRTO 107 (CanLII)  
 12 [48] The event that brought matters to a head for the applicant was the creation of a 
job and the appointment of CQ to that job by the executive managem ent group.
